### THE MANUSCRIPTâ€“AKA, THIS REPO.

The manuscript on this repo has been generated programmatically using [Bookiza Abelone](https://bookiza.io), [h2s](https://github.com/bookiza/h2s) and a few other sanitization libraries. 

Feel free to fork, tweak or republish with new art. Translations to other languages is most welcome.

â†’: As part of publishing vocabulary with the Superbook format, this git repository is the `manuscript` whereas the compile and consumer-ready, distribution-ready, packaged form i.e. the `book` _lives_ on the url linked at the top.
