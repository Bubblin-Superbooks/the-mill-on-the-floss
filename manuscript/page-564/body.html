And mind,—there’s fifty pound o’ Luke’s as I put into the business,—he gave me a bit at a time, and he’s got nothing to show for it. You must pay him first thing.”</p><p>Uncle Glegg involuntarily shook his head, and looked more concerned than ever, but Tom said firmly:</p><p>“Yes, father. And haven’t you a note from my uncle Moss for three hundred pounds? We came to look for that. What do you wish to be done about it, father?”</p><p>“Ah!
