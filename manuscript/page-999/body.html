I’m going to have a long consultation with my uncle Deane this afternoon.”</p><p>“You’ll come to aunt Glegg’s to-morrow? We’re going all to dine early, that we may go there to tea.

I’ve plenty else to do,” said Tom, pulling his bell violently, and bringing down the small bell-rope.</p><p>“I’m frightened; I shall run away,” said Maggie, making a laughing retreat; while Tom, with masculine philosophy, flung the bell-rope to the farther end of the room; not very far either,—a touch of human experience which I flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not a few substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage of their rise in the world, and were cherishing very large hopes in very small lodgings.</p></div> </div>
