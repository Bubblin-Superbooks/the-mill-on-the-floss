The oval lies the wrong way. Please draw them off for me.”</p><p>“Draw them off with your other hand,” says Miss Lucy, roguishly.</p><p>“Oh, but that’s my left hand; I’m not left-handed.”</p><p>Lucy laughs, and the scissors are drawn off with gentle touches from tiny tips, which naturally dispose Mr Stephen for a repetition <em>da capo</em>.
