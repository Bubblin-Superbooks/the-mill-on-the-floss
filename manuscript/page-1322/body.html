At first she heard no sound; she saw no object moving. Her boat was on a level with the upstairs window. She called out in a loud, piercing voice,—</p><p>“Tom, where are you? Mother, where are you? Here is Maggie!”</p><p>Soon, from the window of the attic in the central gable, she heard Tom’s voice,—</p><p>“Who is it? Have you brought a boat?”</p><p>“It is I, Tom,—Maggie. Where is mother?”</p><p>“She is not here; she went to Garum the day before yesterday. I’ll come down to the lower window.”</p><p>“Alone, Maggie?” said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he opened the middle window, on a level with the boat.</p><p>“Yes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you. Get in quickly. Is there no one else?”</p></div> </div>
