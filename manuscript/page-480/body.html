Did you come in the gig?” said Tom, as she backed toward the sofa, and drew him to her side.</p><p>“No, I came by the coach. I’ve walked from the turnpike.”</p><p>“But how is it you’re not at school? The holidays have not begun yet?”</p><p>“Father wanted me at home,” said Maggie, with a slight trembling of the lip. “I came home three or four days ago.”</p><p>“Isn’t my father well?” said Tom, rather anxiously.</p><p>“Not quite,” said Maggie. “He’s very unhappy, Tom. The lawsuit is ended, and I came to tell you because I thought it would be better for you to know it before you came home, and I didn’t like only to send you a letter.”</p><p>“My father hasn’t lost?” said Tom, hastily, springing from the sofa, and standing before Maggie with his hands suddenly thrust into his pockets.</p></div> </div>
