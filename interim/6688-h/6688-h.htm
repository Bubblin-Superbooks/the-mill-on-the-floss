<h3><a name="chap01"></a>Chapter I.<br/>
Outside Dorlcote Mill</h3>

<p>
A wide plain, where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green banks to
the sea, and the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks its passage with an
impetuous embrace. On this mighty tide the black ships&mdash;laden with the
fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of oil-bearing seed, or with the
dark glitter of coal&mdash;are borne along to the town of St Ogg&rsquo;s,
which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the broad gables of its wharves
between the low wooded hill and the river-brink, tingeing the water with a soft
purple hue under the transient glance of this February sun. Far away on each
hand stretch the rich pastures, and the patches of dark earth made ready for
the seed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with the tint of the
tender-bladed autumn-sown corn. There is a remnant still of last year&rsquo;s
golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the hedgerows; and
everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees; the distant ships seem to be
lifting their masts and stretching their red-brown sails close among the
branches of the spreading ash. Just by the red-roofed town the tributary Ripple
flows with a lively current into the Floss. How lovely the little river is,
with its dark changing wavelets! It seems to me like a living companion while I
wander along the bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of
one who is deaf and loving. I remember those large dipping willows. I remember
the stone bridge.
</p>

<p>
And this is Dorlcote Mill. I must stand a minute or two here on the bridge and
look at it, though the clouds are threatening, and it is far on in the
afternoon. Even in this leafless time of departing February it is pleasant to
look at,&mdash;perhaps the chill, damp season adds a charm to the trimly kept,
comfortable dwelling-house, as old as the elms and chestnuts that shelter it
from the northern blast. The stream is brimful now, and lies high in this
little withy plantation, and half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in
front of the house. As I look at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate
bright-green powder softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that
gleam from under the bare purple boughs, I am in love with moistness, and envy
the white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among the
withes, unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier world above.
</p>

<p>
The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy deafness,
which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene. They are like a great
curtain of sound, shutting one out from the world beyond. And now there is the
thunder of the huge covered wagon coming home with sacks of grain. That honest
wagoner is thinking of his dinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this late
hour; but he will not touch it till he has fed his horses,&mdash;the strong,
submissive, meek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him
from between their blinkers, that he should crack his whip at them in that
awful manner as if they needed that hint! See how they stretch their shoulders
up the slope toward the bridge, with all the more energy because they are so
near home. Look at their grand shaggy feet that seem to grasp the firm earth,
at the patient strength of their necks, bowed under the heavy collar, at the
mighty muscles of their struggling haunches! I should like well to hear them
neigh over their hardly-earned feed of corn, and see them, with their moist
necks freed from the harness, dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond.
Now they are on the bridge, and down they go again at a swifter pace, and the
arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the trees.
</p>

<p>
Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again, and watch the unresting wheel
sending out its diamond jets of water. That little girl is watching it too; she
has been standing on just the same spot at the edge of the water ever since I
paused on the bridge. And that queer white cur with the brown ear seems to be
leaping and barking in ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel; perhaps he is
jealous because his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement.
It is time the little playfellow went in, I think; and there is a very bright
fire to tempt her: the red light shines out under the deepening gray of the
sky. It is time, too, for me to leave off resting my arms on the cold stone of
this bridge....
</p>

<p>
Ah, my arms are really benumbed. I have been pressing my elbows on the arms of
my chair, and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in front of Dorlcote
Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years ago. Before I dozed off, I
was going to tell you what Mr and Mrs Tulliver were talking about, as they
sat by the bright fire in the left-hand parlour, on that very afternoon I have
been dreaming of.

<h3><a name="chap02"></a>Chapter II.<br/>
Mr Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;What I want, you know,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver,&mdash;&ldquo;what I
want is to give Tom a good eddication; an eddication as&rsquo;ll be a bread to
him. That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the
academy at Lady-day. I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer.
The two years at th&rsquo; academy &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; done well enough, if
I&rsquo;d meant to make a miller and farmer of him, for he&rsquo;s had a fine
sight more schoolin&rsquo; nor <i>I</i> ever got. All the learnin&rsquo;
<i>my</i> father ever paid for was a bit o&rsquo; birch at one end and the
alphabet at th&rsquo; other. But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard,
so as he might be up to the tricks o&rsquo; these fellows as talk fine and
write with a flourish. It &rsquo;ud be a help to me wi&rsquo; these lawsuits,
and arbitrations, and things. I wouldn&rsquo;t make a downright lawyer o&rsquo;
the lad,&mdash;I should be sorry for him to be a raskill,&mdash;but a sort
o&rsquo; engineer, or a surveyor, or an auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or
one o&rsquo; them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay, only
for a big watch-chain and a high stool. They&rsquo;re pretty nigh all one, and
they&rsquo;re not far off being even wi&rsquo; the law, <i>I</i> believe; for
Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i&rsquo; the face as hard as one cat looks another.
<i>He&rsquo;s</i> none frightened at him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in a fan-shaped cap
(I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped caps were worn, they must
be so near coming in again. At that time, when Mrs Tulliver was nearly forty,
they were new at St Ogg&rsquo;s, and considered sweet things).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr Tulliver, you know best: <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> no objections. But
hadn&rsquo;t I better kill a couple o&rsquo; fowl, and have th&rsquo; aunts and
uncles to dinner next week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister
Pullet have got to say about it? There&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; fowl
<i>wants</i> killing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may kill every fowl i&rsquo; the yard if you like, Bessy; but I
shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what I&rsquo;m to do wi&rsquo; my own
lad,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, defiantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear heart!&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary
rhetoric, &ldquo;how can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? But it&rsquo;s your way to
speak disrespectful o&rsquo; my family; and sister Glegg throws all the blame
upo&rsquo; me, though I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m as innocent as the babe unborn.
For nobody&rsquo;s ever heard me say as it wasn&rsquo;t lucky for my children
to have aunts and uncles as can live independent. Howiver, if Tom&rsquo;s to go
to a new school, I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him;
else he might as well have calico as linen, for they&rsquo;d be one as yallow
as th&rsquo; other before they&rsquo;d been washed half-a-dozen times. And
then, when the box is goin&rsquo; back&rsquo;ard and forrard, I could send the
lad a cake, or a pork-pie, or an apple; for he can do with an extry bit, bless
him! whether they stint him at the meals or no. My children can eat as much
victuals as most, thank God!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, we won&rsquo;t send him out o&rsquo; reach o&rsquo; the
carrier&rsquo;s cart, if other things fit in,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t put a spoke i&rsquo; the wheel about the
washin,&rsquo; if we can&rsquo;t get a school near enough. That&rsquo;s the
fault I have to find wi&rsquo; you, Bessy; if you see a stick i&rsquo; the
road, you&rsquo;re allays thinkin&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t step over it.
You&rsquo;d want me not to hire a good wagoner, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;d got a
mole on his face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear heart!&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, in mild surprise, &ldquo;when did
I iver make objections to a man because he&rsquo;d got a mole on his face?
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m rether fond o&rsquo; the moles; for my brother, as is
dead an&rsquo; gone, had a mole on his brow. But I can&rsquo;t remember your
iver offering to hire a wagoner with a mole, Mr Tulliver. There was John Gibbs
hadn&rsquo;t a mole on his face no more nor you have, an&rsquo; I was all for
having you hire <i>him</i>; an&rsquo; so you did hire him, an&rsquo; if he
hadn&rsquo;t died o&rsquo; th&rsquo; inflammation, as we paid Dr Turnbull for
attending him, he&rsquo;d very like ha&rsquo; been drivin&rsquo; the wagon now.
He might have a mole somewhere out o&rsquo; sight, but how was I to know that,
Mr Tulliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, Bessy; I didn&rsquo;t mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand
for summat else; but niver mind&mdash;it&rsquo;s puzzling work, talking is.
What I&rsquo;m thinking on, is how to find the right sort o&rsquo; school to
send Tom to, for I might be ta&rsquo;en in again, as I&rsquo;ve been wi&rsquo;
th&rsquo; academy. I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do wi&rsquo; a &rsquo;cademy
again: whativer school I send Tom to, it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be a
&rsquo;cademy; it shall be a place where the lads spend their time i&rsquo;
summat else besides blacking the family&rsquo;s shoes, and getting up the
potatoes. It&rsquo;s an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to
pick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his
breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there. Apparently he
was not disappointed, for he presently said, &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do:
I&rsquo;ll talk it over wi&rsquo; Riley; he&rsquo;s coming to-morrow, t&rsquo;
arbitrate about the dam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr Tulliver, I&rsquo;ve put the sheets out for the best bed, and
Kezia&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em hanging at the fire. They aren&rsquo;t the best
sheets, but they&rsquo;re good enough for anybody to sleep in, be he who he
will; for as for them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying &rsquo;em,
only they&rsquo;ll do to lay us out in. An&rsquo; if you was to die to-morrow,
Mr Tulliver, they&rsquo;re mangled beautiful, an&rsquo; all ready, an&rsquo;
smell o&rsquo; lavender as it &rsquo;ud be a pleasure to lay &rsquo;em out;
an&rsquo; they lie at the left-hand corner o&rsquo; the big oak linen-chest at
the back: not as I should trust anybody to look &rsquo;em out but
myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Mrs Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she drew a bright bunch of keys
from her pocket, and singled out one, rubbing her thumb and finger up and down
it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire. If Mr Tulliver had
been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation, he might have supposed that
she drew out the key to aid her imagination in anticipating the moment when he
would be in a state to justify the production of the best Holland sheets.
Happily he was not so; he was only susceptible in respect of his right to
water-power; moreover, he had the marital habit of not listening very closely,
and since his mention of Mr Riley, had been apparently occupied in a tactile
examination of his woollen stockings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve hit it, Bessy,&rdquo; was his first remark after a
short silence. &ldquo;Riley&rsquo;s as likely a man as any to know o&rsquo;
some school; he&rsquo;s had schooling himself, an&rsquo; goes about to all
sorts o&rsquo; places, arbitratin&rsquo; and vallyin&rsquo; and that. And we
shall have time to talk it over to-morrow night when the business is done. I
want Tom to be such a sort o&rsquo; man as Riley, you know,&mdash;as can talk
pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him, and knows a good lot
o&rsquo; words as don&rsquo;t mean much, so as you can&rsquo;t lay hold of
&rsquo;em i&rsquo; law; and a good solid knowledge o&rsquo; business
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, &ldquo;so far as talking proper, and
knowing everything, and walking with a bend in his back, and setting his hair
up, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind the lad being brought up to that. But them
fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts; they
wear a frill till it&rsquo;s all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I know
Riley does. And then, if Tom&rsquo;s to go and live at Mudport, like Riley,
he&rsquo;ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in, an&rsquo;
niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an&rsquo; sleep up three pair o&rsquo;
stairs,&mdash;or four, for what I know,&mdash;and be burnt to death before he
can get down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no thoughts of his
going to Mudport: I mean him to set up his office at St Ogg&rsquo;s, close by
us, an&rsquo; live at home. But,&rdquo; continued Mr Tulliver after a pause,
&ldquo;what I&rsquo;m a bit afraid on is, as Tom hasn&rsquo;t got the right
sort o&rsquo; brains for a smart fellow. I doubt he&rsquo;s a bit slowish. He
takes after your family, Bessy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that he does,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, accepting the last
proposition entirely on its own merits; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s wonderful for liking
a deal o&rsquo; salt in his broth. That was my brother&rsquo;s way, and my
father&rsquo;s before him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems a bit a pity, though,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;as the
lad should take after the mother&rsquo;s side instead o&rsquo; the little
wench. That&rsquo;s the worst on&rsquo;t wi&rsquo; crossing o&rsquo; breeds:
you can never justly calkilate what&rsquo;ll come on&rsquo;t. The little un
takes after my side, now: she&rsquo;s twice as &rsquo;cute as Tom. Too
&rsquo;cute for a woman, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; continued Mr Tulliver,
turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the other.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no mischief much while she&rsquo;s a little un; but an
over-&rsquo;cute woman&rsquo;s no better nor a long-tailed
sheep,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll fetch none the bigger price for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> a mischief while she&rsquo;s a little un, Mr
Tulliver, for it runs to naughtiness. How to keep her in a clean pinafore two
hours together passes my cunning. An&rsquo; now you put me i&rsquo;
mind,&rdquo; continued Mrs Tulliver, rising and going to the window, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know where she is now, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s pretty nigh tea-time.
Ah, I thought so,&mdash;wanderin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down by the water, like a
wild thing: She&rsquo;ll tumble in some day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,&mdash;a
process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You talk o&rsquo; &rsquo;cuteness, Mr Tulliver,&rdquo; she observed as
she sat down, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure the child&rsquo;s half an idiot
i&rsquo; some things; for if I send her upstairs to fetch anything, she forgets
what she&rsquo;s gone for, an&rsquo; perhaps &rsquo;ull sit down on the floor
i&rsquo; the sunshine an&rsquo; plait her hair an&rsquo; sing to herself like a
Bedlam creatur&rsquo;, all the while I&rsquo;m waiting for her downstairs. That
niver run i&rsquo; my family, thank God! no more nor a brown skin as makes her
look like a mulatter. I don&rsquo;t like to fly i&rsquo; the face o&rsquo;
Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but one gell, an&rsquo; her so
comical.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a straight,
black-eyed wench as anybody need wish to see. I don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo; what
she&rsquo;s behind other folks&rsquo;s children; and she can read almost as
well as the parson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But her hair won&rsquo;t curl all I can do with it, and she&rsquo;s so
franzy about having it put i&rsquo; paper, and I&rsquo;ve such work as never
was to make her stand and have it pinched with th&rsquo; irons.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cut it off&mdash;cut it off short,&rdquo; said the father, rashly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? She&rsquo;s too big a gell&mdash;gone
nine, and tall of her age&mdash;to have her hair cut short; an&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s her cousin Lucy&rsquo;s got a row o&rsquo; curls round her head,
an&rsquo; not a hair out o&rsquo; place. It seems hard as my sister Deane
should have that pretty child; I&rsquo;m sure Lucy takes more after me nor my
own child does. Maggie, Maggie,&rdquo; continued the mother, in a tone of
half-coaxing fretfulness, as this small mistake of nature entered the room,
&ldquo;where&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; my telling you to keep away from the
water? You&rsquo;ll tumble in and be drownded some day, an&rsquo; then
you&rsquo;ll be sorry you didn&rsquo;t do as mother told you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s hair, as she threw off her bonnet, painfully confirmed her
mother&rsquo;s accusation. Mrs Tulliver, desiring her daughter to have a
curled crop, &ldquo;like other folks&rsquo;s children,&rdquo; had had it cut
too short in front to be pushed behind the ears; and as it was usually straight
an hour after it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly tossing
her head to keep the dark, heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes,&mdash;an
action which gave her very much the air of a small Shetland pony.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, oh, dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin&rsquo; of, to throw
your bonnet down there? Take it upstairs, there&rsquo;s a good gell, an&rsquo;
let your hair be brushed, an&rsquo; put your other pinafore on, an&rsquo;
change your shoes, do, for shame; an&rsquo; come an&rsquo; go on with your
patchwork, like a little lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to do my patchwork.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt
Glegg?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s foolish work,&rdquo; said Maggie, with a toss of her
mane,&mdash;&ldquo;tearing things to pieces to sew &rsquo;em together again.
And I don&rsquo;t want to do anything for my aunt Glegg. I don&rsquo;t like
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Exit Maggie, dragging her bonnet by the string, while Mr Tulliver laughs
audibly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder at you, as you&rsquo;ll laugh at her, Mr Tulliver,&rdquo; said
the mother, with feeble fretfulness in her tone. &ldquo;You encourage her
i&rsquo; naughtiness. An&rsquo; her aunts will have it as it&rsquo;s me spoils
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person,&mdash;never cried,
when she was a baby, on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and from the
cradle upward had been healthy, fair, plump, and dull-witted; in short, the
flower of her family for beauty and amiability. But milk and mildness are not
the best things for keeping, and when they turn only a little sour, they may
disagree with young stomachs seriously. I have often wondered whether those
early Madonnas of Raphael, with the blond faces and somewhat stupid expression,
kept their placidity undisturbed when their strong-limbed, strong-willed boys
got a little too old to do without clothing. I think they must have been given
to feeble remonstrance, getting more and more peevish as it became more and
more ineffectual.

<h3><a name="chap03"></a>Chapter III.<br/>
Mr Riley Gives His Advice Concerning a School for Tom</h3>

<p>
The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill, taking his
brandy-and-water so pleasantly with his good friend Tulliver, is Mr Riley, a
gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands, rather highly educated for an
auctioneer and appraiser, but large-hearted enough to show a great deal of
<i>bonhomie</i> toward simple country acquaintances of hospitable habits. Mr
Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as &ldquo;people of the old
school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The conversation had come to a pause. Mr Tulliver, not without a particular
reason, had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool retort by which Riley
had shown himself too many for Dix, and how Wakem had had his comb cut for once
in his life, now the business of the dam had been settled by arbitration, and
how there never would have been any dispute at all about the height of water if
everybody was what they should be, and Old Harry hadn&rsquo;t made the lawyers.
Mr Tulliver was, on the whole, a man of safe traditional opinions; but on one
or two points he had trusted to his unassisted intellect, and had arrived at
several questionable conclusions; amongst the rest, that rats, weevils, and
lawyers were created by Old Harry. Unhappily he had no one to tell him that
this was rampant Manichæism, else he might have seen his error. But to-day it
was clear that the good principle was triumphant: this affair of the
water-power had been a tangled business somehow, for all it seemed&mdash;look
at it one way&mdash;as plain as water&rsquo;s water; but, big a puzzle as it
was, it hadn&rsquo;t got the better of Riley. Mr Tulliver took his
brandy-and-water a little stronger than usual, and, for a man who might be
supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his banker&rsquo;s, was rather
incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his friend&rsquo;s
business talents.
</p>

<p>
But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could always be
taken up again at the same point, and exactly in the same condition; and there
was another subject, as you know, on which Mr Tulliver was in pressing want of
Mr Riley&rsquo;s advice. This was his particular reason for remaining silent
for a short space after his last draught, and rubbing his knees in a meditative
manner. He was not a man to make an abrupt transition. This was a puzzling
world, as he often said, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light
on an awkward corner. Mr Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient. Why should he
be? Even Hotspur, one would think, must have been patient in his slippers on a
warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping gratuitous brandy-and-water.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thing I&rsquo;ve got i&rsquo; my head,&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver at last, in rather a lower tone than usual, as he turned his head and
looked steadfastly at his companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr Riley, in a tone of mild interest. He was a man with
heavy waxen eyelids and high-arched eyebrows, looking exactly the same under
all circumstances. This immovability of face, and the habit of taking a pinch
of snuff before he gave an answer, made him trebly oracular to Mr Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very particular thing,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
about my boy Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At the sound of this name, Maggie, who was seated on a low stool close by the
fire, with a large book open on her lap, shook her heavy hair back and looked
up eagerly. There were few sounds that roused Maggie when she was dreaming over
her book, but Tom&rsquo;s name served as well as the shrillest whistle; in an
instant she was on the watch, with gleaming eyes, like a Skye terrier
suspecting mischief, or at all events determined to fly at any one who
threatened it toward Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer,&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; away from the &rsquo;cademy at
Lady-day, an&rsquo; I shall let him run loose for a quarter; but after that I
want to send him to a downright good school, where they&rsquo;ll make a
scholard of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr Riley, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no greater advantage
you can give him than a good education. Not,&rdquo; he added, with polite
significance,&mdash;&ldquo;not that a man can&rsquo;t be an excellent miller
and farmer, and a shrewd, sensible fellow into the bargain, without much help
from the schoolmaster.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, winking, and turning his head
on one side; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s where it is. I don&rsquo;t <i>mean</i> Tom
to be a miller and farmer. I see no fun i&rsquo; that. Why, if I made him a
miller an&rsquo; farmer, he&rsquo;d be expectin&rsquo; to take to the mill
an&rsquo; the land, an&rsquo; a-hinting at me as it was time for me to lay by
an&rsquo; think o&rsquo; my latter end. Nay, nay, I&rsquo;ve seen enough
o&rsquo; that wi&rsquo; sons. I&rsquo;ll never pull my coat off before I go to
bed. I shall give Tom an eddication an&rsquo; put him to a business, as he may
make a nest for himself, an&rsquo; not want to push me out o&rsquo; mine.
Pretty well if he gets it when I&rsquo;m dead an&rsquo; gone. I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be put off wi&rsquo; spoon-meat afore I&rsquo;ve lost my
teeth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was evidently a point on which Mr Tulliver felt strongly; and the impetus
which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech showed itself still
unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a defiant motion of the head from
side to side, and an occasional &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; like a subsiding growl.
</p>

<p>
These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her to the quick.
Tom, it appeared, was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors, and
of making the future in some way tragic by his wickedness. This was not to be
borne; and Maggie jumped up from her stool, forgetting all about her heavy
book, which fell with a bang within the fender, and going up between her
father&rsquo;s knees, said, in a half-crying, half-indignant voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father, Tom wouldn&rsquo;t be naughty to you ever; I know he
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper-dish, and Mr
Tulliver&rsquo;s heart was touched; so Maggie was not scolded about the book.
Mr Riley quietly picked it up and looked at it, while the father laughed, with
a certain tenderness in his hard-lined face, and patted his little girl on the
back, and then held her hands and kept her between his knees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! they mustn&rsquo;t say any harm o&rsquo; Tom, eh?&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver, looking at Maggie with a twinkling eye. Then, in a lower voice,
turning to Mr Riley, as though Maggie couldn&rsquo;t hear, &ldquo;She
understands what one&rsquo;s talking about so as never was. And you should hear
her read,&mdash;straight off, as if she knowed it all beforehand. And allays at
her book! But it&rsquo;s bad&mdash;it&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; Mr Tulliver added
sadly, checking this blamable exultation. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s no business
wi&rsquo; being so clever; it&rsquo;ll turn to trouble, I doubt. But bless
you!&rdquo;&mdash;here the exultation was clearly recovering the
mastery,&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;ll read the books and understand &rsquo;em
better nor half the folks as are growed up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement. She thought
Mr Riley would have a respect for her now; it had been evident that he thought
nothing of her before.
</p>

<p>
Mr Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make nothing
of his face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently looked at her, and
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come and tell me something about this book; here are some
pictures,&mdash;I want to know what they mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie, with deepening colour, went without hesitation to Mr Riley&rsquo;s
elbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing back
her mane, while she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you what that means. It&rsquo;s a dreadful picture,
isn&rsquo;t it? But I can&rsquo;t help looking at it. That old woman in the
water&rsquo;s a witch,&mdash;they&rsquo;ve put her in to find out whether
she&rsquo;s a witch or no; and if she swims she&rsquo;s a witch, and if
she&rsquo;s drowned&mdash;and killed, you know&mdash;she&rsquo;s innocent, and
not a witch, but only a poor silly old woman. But what good would it do her
then, you know, when she was drowned? Only, I suppose, she&rsquo;d go to
heaven, and God would make it up to her. And this dreadful blacksmith with his
arms akimbo, laughing,&mdash;oh, isn&rsquo;t he ugly?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what he is. He&rsquo;s the Devil <i>really</i>&rdquo; (here Maggie&rsquo;s
voice became louder and more emphatic), &ldquo;and not a right blacksmith; for
the Devil takes the shape of wicked men, and walks about and sets people doing
wicked things, and he&rsquo;s oftener in the shape of a bad man than any other,
because, you know, if people saw he was the Devil, and he roared at &rsquo;em,
they&rsquo;d run away, and he couldn&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em do what he
pleased.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver had listened to this exposition of Maggie&rsquo;s with petrifying
wonder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what book is it the wench has got hold on?&rdquo; he burst out at
last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The History of the Devil,&rsquo; by Daniel Defoe,&mdash;not quite
the right book for a little girl,&rdquo; said Mr Riley. &ldquo;How came it
among your books, Mr Tulliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie looked hurt and discouraged, while her father said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the books I bought at Partridge&rsquo;s
sale. They was all bound alike,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good binding, you
see,&mdash;and I thought they&rsquo;d be all good books. There&rsquo;s Jeremy
Taylor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Holy Living and Dying&rsquo; among &rsquo;em. I read in
it often of a Sunday&rdquo; (Mr Tulliver felt somehow a familiarity with that
great writer, because his name was Jeremy); &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s a lot more
of &rsquo;em,&mdash;sermons mostly, I think,&mdash;but they&rsquo;ve all got
the same covers, and I thought they were all o&rsquo; one sample, as you may
say. But it seems one mustn&rsquo;t judge by th&rsquo; outside. This is a
puzzlin&rsquo; world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr Riley, in an admonitory, patronizing tone as he
patted Maggie on the head, &ldquo;I advise you to put by the &lsquo;History of
the Devil,&rsquo; and read some prettier book. Have you no prettier
books?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Maggie, reviving a little in the desire to
vindicate the variety of her reading. &ldquo;I know the reading in this book
isn&rsquo;t pretty; but I like the pictures, and I make stories to the pictures
out of my own head, you know. But I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;Æsop&rsquo;s
Fables,&rsquo; and a book about Kangaroos and things, and the
&lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress....&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, a beautiful book,&rdquo; said Mr Riley; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t read
a better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but there&rsquo;s a great deal about the Devil in that,&rdquo;
said Maggie, triumphantly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show you the picture of him in
his true shape, as he fought with Christian.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room, jumped on a chair, and
reached down from the small bookcase a shabby old copy of Bunyan, which opened
at once, without the least trouble of search, at the picture she wanted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; she said, running back to Mr Riley, &ldquo;and Tom
coloured him for me with his paints when he was at home last
holidays,&mdash;the body all black, you know, and the eyes red, like fire,
because he&rsquo;s all fire inside, and it shines out at his eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily, beginning to feel rather
uncomfortable at these free remarks on the personal appearance of a being
powerful enough to create lawyers; &ldquo;shut up the book, and let&rsquo;s
hear no more o&rsquo; such talk. It is as I thought&mdash;the child &rsquo;ull
learn more mischief nor good wi&rsquo; the books. Go, go and see after your
mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie shut up the book at once, with a sense of disgrace, but not being
inclined to see after her mother, she compromised the matter by going into a
dark corner behind her father&rsquo;s chair, and nursing her doll, toward which
she had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom&rsquo;s absence, neglecting its
toilet, but lavishing so many warm kisses on it that the waxen cheeks had a
wasted, unhealthy appearance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you ever hear the like on&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, as
Maggie retired. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity but what she&rsquo;d been the
lad,&mdash;she&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been a match for the lawyers, <i>she</i>
would. It&rsquo;s the wonderful&rsquo;st thing&rdquo;&mdash;here he lowered his
voice&mdash;&ldquo;as I picked the mother because she wasn&rsquo;t o&rsquo;er
&rsquo;cute&mdash;bein&rsquo; a good-looking woman too, an&rsquo; come of a
rare family for managing; but I picked her from her sisters o&rsquo; purpose,
&rsquo;cause she was a bit weak like; for I wasn&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to be
told the rights o&rsquo; things by my own fireside. But you see when a
man&rsquo;s got brains himself, there&rsquo;s no knowing where they&rsquo;ll
run to; an&rsquo; a pleasant sort o&rsquo; soft woman may go on breeding you
stupid lads and &rsquo;cute wenches, till it&rsquo;s like as if the world was
turned topsy-turvy. It&rsquo;s an uncommon puzzlin&rsquo; thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Riley&rsquo;s gravity gave way, and he shook a little under the application
of his pinch of snuff before he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But your lad&rsquo;s not stupid, is he? I saw him, when I was here last,
busy making fishing-tackle; he seemed quite up to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t not to say stupid,&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a notion
o&rsquo; things out o&rsquo; door, an&rsquo; a sort o&rsquo; common sense, as
he&rsquo;d lay hold o&rsquo; things by the right handle. But he&rsquo;s slow
with his tongue, you see, and he reads but poorly, and can&rsquo;t abide the
books, and spells all wrong, they tell me, an&rsquo; as shy as can be wi&rsquo;
strangers, an&rsquo; you never hear him say &rsquo;cute things like the little
wench. Now, what I want is to send him to a school where they&rsquo;ll make him
a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen, and make a smart chap of him. I want
my son to be even wi&rsquo; these fellows as have got the start o&rsquo; me
with having better schooling. Not but what, if the world had been left as God
made it, I could ha&rsquo; seen my way, and held my own wi&rsquo; the best of
&rsquo;em; but things have got so twisted round and wrapped up i&rsquo;
unreasonable words, as aren&rsquo;t a bit like &rsquo;em, as I&rsquo;m clean at
fault, often an&rsquo; often. Everything winds about so&mdash;the more
straightforrad you are, the more you&rsquo;re puzzled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver took a draught, swallowed it slowly, and shook his head in a
melancholy manner, conscious of exemplifying the truth that a perfectly sane
intellect is hardly at home in this insane world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite in the right of it, Tulliver,&rdquo; observed Mr
Riley. &ldquo;Better spend an extra hundred or two on your son&rsquo;s
education, than leave it him in your will. I know I should have tried to do so
by a son of mine, if I&rsquo;d had one, though, God knows, I haven&rsquo;t your
ready money to play with, Tulliver; and I have a houseful of daughters into the
bargain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say, now, you know of a school as &rsquo;ud be just the thing for
Tom,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, not diverted from his purpose by any sympathy
with Mr Riley&rsquo;s deficiency of ready cash.
</p>

<p>
Mr Riley took a pinch of snuff, and kept Mr Tulliver in suspense by a silence
that seemed deliberative, before he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know of a very fine chance for any one that&rsquo;s got the necessary
money and that&rsquo;s what you have, Tulliver. The fact is, I wouldn&rsquo;t
recommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular school, if he could
afford to do better. But if any one wanted his boy to get superior instruction
and training, where he would be the companion of his master, and that master a
first rate fellow, I know his man. I wouldn&rsquo;t mention the chance to
everybody, because I don&rsquo;t think everybody would succeed in getting it,
if he were to try; but I mention it to you, Tulliver, between ourselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fixed inquiring glance with which Mr Tulliver had been watching his
friend&rsquo;s oracular face became quite eager.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, now, let&rsquo;s hear,&rdquo; he said, adjusting himself in his
chair with the complacency of a person who is thought worthy of important
communications.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Oxford man,&rdquo; said Mr Riley, sententiously, shutting
his mouth close, and looking at Mr Tulliver to observe the effect of this
stimulating information.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! a parson?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, rather doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and an M.A. The bishop, I understand, thinks very highly of him:
why, it was the bishop who got him his present curacy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, to whom one thing was as wonderful as
another concerning these unfamiliar phenomena. &ldquo;But what can he want
wi&rsquo; Tom, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, the fact is, he&rsquo;s fond of teaching, and wishes to keep up his
studies, and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his parochial
duties. He&rsquo;s willing to take one or two boys as pupils to fill up his
time profitably. The boys would be quite of the family,&mdash;the finest thing
in the world for them; under Stelling&rsquo;s eye continually.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But do you think they&rsquo;d give the poor lad twice o&rsquo;
pudding?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, who was now in her place again.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a boy for pudding as never was; an&rsquo; a growing boy
like that,&mdash;it&rsquo;s dreadful to think o&rsquo; their stintin&rsquo;
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what money &rsquo;ud he want?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, whose
instinct told him that the services of this admirable M.A. would bear a high
price.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his
youngest pupils, and he&rsquo;s not to be mentioned with Stelling, the man I
speak of. I know, on good authority, that one of the chief people at Oxford
said, Stelling might get the highest honours if he chose. But he didn&rsquo;t
care about university honours; he&rsquo;s a quiet man&mdash;not noisy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, a deal better&mdash;a deal better,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver;
&ldquo;but a hundred and fifty&rsquo;s an uncommon price. I never thought
o&rsquo; paying so much as that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good education, let me tell you, Tulliver,&mdash;a good education is
cheap at the money. But Stelling is moderate in his terms; he&rsquo;s not a
grasping man. I&rsquo;ve no doubt he&rsquo;d take your boy at a hundred, and
that&rsquo;s what you wouldn&rsquo;t get many other clergymen to do. I&rsquo;ll
write to him about it, if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver rubbed his knees, and looked at the carpet in a meditative manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But belike he&rsquo;s a bachelor,&rdquo; observed Mrs Tulliver, in the
interval; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve no opinion o&rsquo; housekeepers. There
was my brother, as is dead an&rsquo; gone, had a housekeeper once, an&rsquo;
she took half the feathers out o&rsquo; the best bed, an&rsquo; packed
&rsquo;em up an&rsquo; sent &rsquo;em away. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s unknown the
linen she made away with&mdash;Stott her name was. It &rsquo;ud break my heart
to send Tom where there&rsquo;s a housekeeper, an&rsquo; I hope you won&rsquo;t
think of it, Mr Tulliver.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may set your mind at rest on that score, Mrs Tulliver,&rdquo; said
Mr Riley, &ldquo;for Stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man
need wish for a wife. There isn&rsquo;t a kinder little soul in the world; I
know her family well. She has very much your complexion,&mdash;light curly
hair. She comes of a good Mudport family, and it&rsquo;s not every offer that
would have been acceptable in that quarter. But Stelling&rsquo;s not an
everyday man; rather a particular fellow as to the people he chooses to be
connected with. But I <i>think</i> he would have no objection to take your son;
I <i>think</i> he would not, on my representation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he could have <i>against</i> the lad,&rdquo;
said Mrs Tulliver, with a slight touch of motherly indignation; &ldquo;a nice
fresh-skinned lad as anybody need wish to see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m thinking on,&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver, turning his head on one side and looking at Mr Riley, after a long
perusal of the carpet. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t a parson be almost too high-learnt
to bring up a lad to be a man o&rsquo; business? My notion o&rsquo; the parsons
was as they&rsquo;d got a sort o&rsquo; learning as lay mostly out o&rsquo;
sight. And that isn&rsquo;t what I want for Tom. I want him to know figures,
and write like print, and see into things quick, and know what folks mean, and
how to wrap things up in words as aren&rsquo;t actionable. It&rsquo;s an
uncommon fine thing, that is,&rdquo; concluded Mr Tulliver, shaking his head,
&ldquo;when you can let a man know what you think of him without paying for
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear Tulliver,&rdquo; said Mr Riley, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re quite
under a mistake about the clergy; all the best schoolmasters are of the clergy.
The schoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very low set of men
generally.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, that Jacobs is, at the &rsquo;cademy,&rdquo; interposed Mr
Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure,&mdash;men who have failed in other trades, most likely. Now,
a clergyman is a gentleman by profession and education; and besides that, he
has the knowledge that will ground a boy, and prepare him for entering on any
career with credit. There may be some clergymen who are mere bookmen; but you
may depend upon it, Stelling is not one of them,&mdash;a man that&rsquo;s wide
awake, let me tell you. Drop him a hint, and that&rsquo;s enough. You talk of
figures, now; you have only to say to Stelling, &lsquo;I want my son to be a
thorough arithmetician,&rsquo; and you may leave the rest to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Riley paused a moment, while Mr Tulliver, somewhat reassured as to clerical
tutorship, was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary Mr Stelling the statement,
&ldquo;I want my son to know &rsquo;rethmetic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, my dear Tulliver,&rdquo; Mr Riley continued, &ldquo;when you
get a thoroughly educated man, like Stelling, he&rsquo;s at no loss to take up
any branch of instruction. When a workman knows the use of his tools, he can
make a door as well as a window.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, almost convinced now
that the clergy must be the best of schoolmasters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do for you,&rdquo; said Mr
Riley, &ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t do it for everybody. I&rsquo;ll see
Stelling&rsquo;s father-in-law, or drop him a line when I get back to Mudport,
to say that you wish to place your boy with his son-in-law, and I dare say
Stelling will write to you, and send you his terms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no hurry, is there?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver;
&ldquo;for I hope, Mr Tulliver, you won&rsquo;t let Tom begin at his new
school before Midsummer. He began at the &rsquo;cademy at the Lady-day quarter,
and you see what good&rsquo;s come of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Bessy, never brew wi&rsquo; bad malt upo&rsquo; Michaelmas day,
else you&rsquo;ll have a poor tap,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, winking and
smiling at Mr Riley, with the natural pride of a man who has a buxom wife
conspicuously his inferior in intellect. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true
there&rsquo;s no hurry; you&rsquo;ve hit it there, Bessy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long,&rdquo; said
Mr Riley, quietly, &ldquo;for Stelling may have propositions from other
parties, and I know he would not take more than two or three boarders, if so
many. If I were you, I think I would enter on the subject with Stelling at
once: there&rsquo;s no necessity for sending the boy before Midsummer, but I
would be on the safe side, and make sure that nobody forestalls you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, there&rsquo;s summat in that,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; broke in Maggie, who had stolen unperceived to her
father&rsquo;s elbow again, listening with parted lips, while she held her doll
topsy-turvy, and crushed its nose against the wood of the
chair,&mdash;&ldquo;father, is it a long way off where Tom is to go?
Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we ever go to see him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my wench,&rdquo; said the father, tenderly.
&ldquo;Ask Mr Riley; he knows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie came round promptly in front of Mr Riley, and said, &ldquo;How far is
it, please, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, a long, long way off,&rdquo; that gentleman answered, being of
opinion that children, when they are not naughty, should always be spoken to
jocosely. &ldquo;You must borrow the seven-leagued boots to get to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo; said Maggie, tossing her head haughtily,
and turning away, with the tears springing in her eyes. She began to dislike
Mr Riley; it was evident he thought her silly and of no consequence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, Maggie! for shame of you, asking questions and chattering,&rdquo;
said her mother. &ldquo;Come and sit down on your little stool, and hold your
tongue, do. But,&rdquo; added Mrs Tulliver, who had her own alarm awakened,
&ldquo;is it so far off as I couldn&rsquo;t wash him and mend him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About fifteen miles; that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Mr Riley. &ldquo;You
can drive there and back in a day quite comfortably. Or&mdash;Stelling is a
hospitable, pleasant man&mdash;he&rsquo;d be glad to have you stay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too far off for the linen, I doubt,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, sadly.
</p>

<p>
The entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty, and relieved Mr
Riley from the labour of suggesting some solution or compromise,&mdash;a labour
which he would otherwise doubtless have undertaken; for, as you perceive, he
was a man of very obliging manners. And he had really given himself the trouble
of recommending Mr Stelling to his friend Tulliver without any positive
expectation of a solid, definite advantage resulting to himself,
notwithstanding the subtle indications to the contrary which might have misled
a too sagacious observer. For there is nothing more widely misleading than
sagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent; and sagacity, persuaded that
men usually act and speak from distinct motives, with a consciously proposed
end in view, is certain to waste its energies on imaginary game.
</p>

<p>
Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance, in order to compass a selfish
end, are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist: they demand too
intense a mental action for many of our fellow-parishioners to be guilty of
them. It is easy enough to spoil the lives of our neighbours without taking so
much trouble; we can do it by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission, by trivial
falsities for which we hardly know a reason, by small frauds neutralised by
small extravagances, by maladroit flatteries, and clumsily improvised
insinuations. We live from hand to mouth, most of us, with a small family of
immediate desires; we do little else than snatch a morsel to satisfy the hungry
brood, rarely thinking of seed-corn or the next year&rsquo;s crop.
</p>

<p>
Mr Riley was a man of business, and not cold toward his own interest, yet even
he was more under the influence of small promptings than of far-sighted
designs. He had no private understanding with the Rev. Walter Stelling; on the
contrary, he knew very little of that M.A. and his acquirements,&mdash;not
quite enough, perhaps, to warrant so strong a recommendation of him as he had
given to his friend Tulliver. But he believed Mr Stelling to be an excellent
classic, for Gadsby had said so, and Gadsby&rsquo;s first cousin was an Oxford
tutor; which was better ground for the belief even than his own immediate
observation would have been, for though Mr Riley had received a tincture of the
classics at the great Mudport Free School, and had a sense of understanding
Latin generally, his comprehension of any particular Latin was not ready.
Doubtless there remained a subtle aroma from his juvenile contact with the
<i>De Senectute</i> and the fourth book of the <i>Æneid</i>, but it had ceased
to be distinctly recognisable as classical, and was only perceived in the
higher finish and force of his auctioneering style. Then, Stelling was an
Oxford man, and the Oxford men were always&mdash;no, no, it was the Cambridge
men who were always good mathematicians. But a man who had had a university
education could teach anything he liked; especially a man like Stelling, who
had made a speech at a Mudport dinner on a political occasion, and had
acquitted himself so well that it was generally remarked, this son-in-law of
Timpson&rsquo;s was a sharp fellow. It was to be expected of a Mudport man,
from the parish of St Ursula, that he would not omit to do a good turn to a
son-in-law of Timpson&rsquo;s, for Timpson was one of the most useful and
influential men in the parish, and had a good deal of business, which he knew
how to put into the right hands. Mr Riley liked such men, quite apart from any
money which might be diverted, through their good judgment, from less worthy
pockets into his own; and it would be a satisfaction to him to say to Timpson
on his return home, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve secured a good pupil for your
son-in-law.&rdquo; Timpson had a large family of daughters; Mr Riley felt for
him; besides, Louisa Timpson&rsquo;s face, with its light curls, had been a
familiar object to him over the pew wainscot on a Sunday for nearly fifteen
years; it was natural her husband should be a commendable tutor. Moreover, Mr
Riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any ground for recommending in
preference; why, then, should he not recommend Stelling? His friend Tulliver
had asked him for an opinion; it is always chilling, in friendly intercourse,
to say you have no opinion to give. And if you deliver an opinion at all, it is
mere stupidity not to do it with an air of conviction and well-founded
knowledge. You make it your own in uttering it, and naturally get fond of it.
Thus Mr Riley, knowing no harm of Stelling to begin with, and wishing him well,
so far as he had any wishes at all concerning him, had no sooner recommended
him than he began to think with admiration of a man recommended on such high
authority, and would soon have gathered so warm an interest on the subject,
that if Mr Tulliver had in the end declined to send Tom to Stelling, Mr Riley
would have thought his &ldquo;friend of the old school&rdquo; a thoroughly
pig-headed fellow.
</p>

<p>
If you blame Mr Riley very severely for giving a recommendation on such slight
grounds, I must say you are rather hard upon him. Why should an auctioneer and
appraiser thirty years ago, who had as good as forgotten his free-school Latin,
be expected to manifest a delicate scrupulosity which is not always exhibited
by gentlemen of the learned professions, even in our present advanced stage of
morality?
</p>

<p>
Besides, a man with the milk of human kindness in him can scarcely abstain from
doing a good-natured action, and one cannot be good-natured all round. Nature
herself occasionally quarters an inconvenient parasite on an animal toward whom
she has otherwise no ill will. What then? We admire her care for the parasite.
If Mr Riley had shrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on
valid evidence, he would not have helped Mr Stelling to a paying pupil, and
that would not have been so well for the reverend gentleman. Consider, too,
that all the pleasant little dim ideas and complacencies&mdash;of standing well
with Timpson, of dispensing advice when he was asked for it, of impressing his
friend Tulliver with additional respect, of saying something, and saying it
emphatically, with other inappreciably minute ingredients that went along with
the warm hearth and the brandy-and-water to make up Mr Riley&rsquo;s
consciousness on this occasion&mdash;would have been a mere blank.

Tom Is Expected</h3>

<p>
It was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she was not allowed to go with her
father in the gig when he went to fetch Tom home from the academy; but the
morning was too wet, Mrs Tulliver said, for a little girl to go out in her
best bonnet. Maggie took the opposite view very strongly, and it was a direct
consequence of this difference of opinion that when her mother was in the act
of brushing out the reluctant black crop Maggie suddenly rushed from under her
hands and dipped her head in a basin of water standing near, in the vindictive
determination that there should be no more chance of curls that day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie, Maggie!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Tulliver, sitting stout and
helpless with the brushes on her lap, &ldquo;what is to become of you if
you&rsquo;re so naughty? I&rsquo;ll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet
when they come next week, and they&rsquo;ll never love you any more. Oh dear,
oh dear! look at your clean pinafore, wet from top to bottom. Folks &rsquo;ull
think it&rsquo;s a judgment on me as I&rsquo;ve got such a
child,&mdash;they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;ve done summat wicked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before this remonstrance was finished, Maggie was already out of hearing,
making her way toward the great attic that run under the old high-pitched roof,
shaking the water from her black locks as she ran, like a Skye terrier escaped
from his bath. This attic was Maggie&rsquo;s favourite retreat on a wet day,
when the weather was not too cold; here she fretted out all her ill humours,
and talked aloud to the worm-eaten floors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the
dark rafters festooned with cobwebs; and here she kept a Fetish which she
punished for all her misfortunes. This was the trunk of a large wooden doll,
which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks; but
was now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering. Three nails
driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie&rsquo;s nine years
of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been suggested to her by
the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old Bible. The last nail had been
driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual, for the Fetish on that occasion
represented aunt Glegg. But immediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if
she drove many nails in she would not be so well able to fancy that the head
was hurt when she knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort it, and make
believe to poultice it, when her fury was abated; for even aunt Glegg would be
pitiable when she had been hurt very much, and thoroughly humiliated, so as to
beg her niece&rsquo;s pardon. Since then she had driven no more nails in, but
had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating the wooden head against
the rough brick of the great chimneys that made two square pillars supporting
the roof. That was what she did this morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all
the while with a passion that expelled every other form of
consciousness,&mdash;even the memory of the grievance that had caused it. As at
last the sobs were getting quieter, and the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam
of sunshine, falling through the wire lattice across the worm-eaten shelves,
made her throw away the Fetish and run to the window. The sun was really
breaking out; the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again; the granary doors
were open; and there was Yap, the queer white-and-brown terrier, with one ear
turned back, trotting about and sniffing vaguely, as if he were in search of a
companion. It was irresistible. Maggie tossed her hair back and ran downstairs,
seized her bonnet without putting it on, peeped, and then dashed along the
passage lest she should encounter her mother, and was quickly out in the yard,
whirling round like a Pythoness, and singing as she whirled, &ldquo;Yap, Yap,
Tom&rsquo;s coming home!&rdquo; while Yap danced and barked round her, as much
as to say, if there was any noise wanted he was the dog for it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hegh, hegh, Miss! you&rsquo;ll make yourself giddy, an&rsquo; tumble
down i&rsquo; the dirt,&rdquo; said Luke, the head miller, a tall,
broad-shouldered man of forty, black-eyed and black-haired, subdued by a
general mealiness, like an auricula.
</p>

<p>
Maggie paused in her whirling and said, staggering a little, &ldquo;Oh no, it
doesn&rsquo;t make me giddy, Luke; may I go into the mill with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came out with
her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark eyes flash out
with new fire. The resolute din, the unresting motion of the great stones,
giving her a dim, delicious awe as at the presence of an uncontrollable force;
the meal forever pouring, pouring; the fine white powder softening all
surfaces, and making the very spidernets look like a faery lace-work; the
sweet, pure scent of the meal,&mdash;all helped to make Maggie feel that the
mill was a little world apart from her outside everyday life. The spiders were
especially a subject of speculation with her. She wondered if they had any
relatives outside the mill, for in that case there must be a painful difficulty
in their family intercourse,&mdash;a fat and floury spider, accustomed to take
his fly well dusted with meal, must suffer a little at a cousin&rsquo;s table
where the fly was <i>au naturel</i>, and the lady spiders must be mutually
shocked at each other&rsquo;s appearance. But the part of the mill she liked
best was the topmost story,&mdash;the corn-hutch, where there were the great
heaps of grain, which she could sit on and slide down continually. She was in
the habit of taking this recreation as she conversed with Luke, to whom she was
very communicative, wishing him to think well of her understanding, as her
father did.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the present
occasion for, as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near which he was busying
himself, she said, at that shrill pitch which was requisite in
mill-society,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you never read any book but the Bible, did you, Luke?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, Miss, an&rsquo; not much o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Luke, with
great frankness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no reader, I aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if I lent you one of my books, Luke? I&rsquo;ve not got any
<i>very</i> pretty books that would be easy for you to read; but there&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Pug&rsquo;s Tour of Europe,&rsquo;&mdash;that would tell you all about
the different sorts of people in the world, and if you didn&rsquo;t understand
the reading, the pictures would help you; they show the looks and ways of the
people, and what they do. There are the Dutchmen, very fat, and smoking, you
know, and one sitting on a barrel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, Miss, I&rsquo;n no opinion o&rsquo; Dutchmen. There ben&rsquo;t
much good i&rsquo; knowin&rsquo; about <i>them</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re our fellow-creatures, Luke; we ought to know about our
fellow-creatures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not much o&rsquo; fellow-creaturs, I think, Miss; all I know&mdash;my
old master, as war a knowin&rsquo; man, used to say, says he, &lsquo;If
e&rsquo;er I sow my wheat wi&rsquo;out brinin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m a
Dutchman,&rsquo; says he; an&rsquo; that war as much as to say as a Dutchman
war a fool, or next door. Nay, nay, I aren&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to bother mysen
about Dutchmen. There&rsquo;s fools enoo, an&rsquo; rogues enoo, wi&rsquo;out
lookin&rsquo; i&rsquo; books for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke&rsquo;s unexpectedly
decided views about Dutchmen, &ldquo;perhaps you would like &lsquo;Animated
Nature&rsquo; better; that&rsquo;s not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants and
kangaroos, and the civet-cat, and the sunfish, and a bird sitting on its
tail,&mdash;I forget its name. There are countries full of those creatures,
instead of horses and cows, you know. Shouldn&rsquo;t you like to know about
them, Luke?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, Miss, I&rsquo;n got to keep count o&rsquo; the flour an&rsquo;
corn; I can&rsquo;t do wi&rsquo; knowin&rsquo; so many things besides my work.
That&rsquo;s what brings folks to the gallows,&mdash;knowin&rsquo; everything
but what they&rsquo;n got to get their bread by. An&rsquo; they&rsquo;re mostly
lies, I think, what&rsquo;s printed i&rsquo; the books: them printed sheets
are, anyhow, as the men cry i&rsquo; the streets.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re like my brother Tom, Luke,&rdquo; said Maggie, wishing
to turn the conversation agreeably; &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s not fond of reading. I
love Tom so dearly, Luke,&mdash;better than anybody else in the world. When he
grows up I shall keep his house, and we shall always live together. I can tell
him everything he doesn&rsquo;t know. But I think Tom&rsquo;s clever, for all
he doesn&rsquo;t like books; he makes beautiful whipcord and
rabbit-pens.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Luke, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll be fine an&rsquo; vexed, as
the rabbits are all dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; screamed Maggie, jumping up from her sliding seat on the
corn. &ldquo;Oh dear, Luke! What! the lop-eared one, and the spotted doe that
Tom spent all his money to buy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As dead as moles,&rdquo; said Luke, fetching his comparison from the
unmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, Luke,&rdquo; said Maggie, in a piteous tone, while the big
tears rolled down her cheek; &ldquo;Tom told me to take care of &rsquo;em, and
I forgot. What <i>shall</i> I do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you see, Miss, they were in that far tool-house, an&rsquo; it was
nobody&rsquo;s business to see to &rsquo;em. I reckon Master Tom told Harry to
feed &rsquo;em, but there&rsquo;s no countin&rsquo; on Harry; <i>he&rsquo;s</i>
a offal creatur as iver come about the primises, he is. He remembers nothing
but his own inside&mdash;an&rsquo; I wish it &rsquo;ud gripe him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Luke, Tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day; but
how could I, when they didn&rsquo;t come into my head, you know? Oh, he will be
so angry with me, I know he will, and so sorry about his rabbits, and so am I
sorry. Oh, what <i>shall</i> I do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret, Miss,&rdquo; said Luke, soothingly;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re nash things, them lop-eared rabbits; they&rsquo;d happen
ha&rsquo; died, if they&rsquo;d been fed. Things out o&rsquo; natur niver
thrive: God A&rsquo;mighty doesn&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em. He made the
rabbits&rsquo; ears to lie back, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but
contrairiness to make &rsquo;em hing down like a mastiff dog&rsquo;s. Master
Tom &rsquo;ull know better nor buy such things another time. Don&rsquo;t you
fret, Miss. Will you come along home wi&rsquo; me, and see my wife? I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; this minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie&rsquo;s grief, and
her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke&rsquo;s side to his
pleasant cottage, which stood with its apple and pear trees, and with the added
dignity of a lean-to pigsty, at the other end of the Mill fields. Mrs Moggs,
Luke&rsquo;s wife, was a decidedly agreeable acquaintance. She exhibited her
hospitality in bread and treacle, and possessed various works of art. Maggie
actually forgot that she had any special cause of sadness this morning, as she
stood on a chair to look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the
Prodigal Son in the costume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might
have been expected from his defective moral character, he had not, like that
accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a wig. But
the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind caused her to feel
more than usual pity for the career of this weak young man, particularly when
she looked at the picture where he leaned against a tree with a flaccid
appearance, his knee-breeches unbuttoned and his wig awry, while the swine
apparently of some foreign breed, seemed to insult him by their good spirits
over their feast of husks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad his father took him back again, aren&rsquo;t you,
Luke?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For he was very sorry, you know, and
wouldn&rsquo;t do wrong again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Miss,&rdquo; said Luke, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be no great shakes, I
doubt, let&rsquo;s feyther do what he would for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was a painful thought to Maggie, and she wished much that the subsequent
history of the young man had not been left a blank.

Tom Comes Home</h3>

<p>
Tom was to arrive early in the afternoon, and there was another fluttering
heart besides Maggie&rsquo;s when it was late enough for the sound of the
gig-wheels to be expected; for if Mrs Tulliver had a strong feeling, it was
fondness for her boy. At last the sound came,&mdash;that quick light bowling of
the gig-wheels,&mdash;and in spite of the wind, which was blowing the clouds
about, and was not likely to respect Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s curls and
cap-strings, she came outside the door, and even held her hand on
Maggie&rsquo;s offending head, forgetting all the griefs of the morning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There he is, my sweet lad! But, Lord ha&rsquo; mercy! he&rsquo;s got
never a collar on; it&rsquo;s been lost on the road, I&rsquo;ll be bound, and
spoilt the set.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver stood with her arms open; Maggie jumped first on one leg and then
on the other; while Tom descended from the gig, and said, with masculine
reticence as to the tender emotions, &ldquo;Hallo! Yap&mdash;what! are you
there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless he submitted to be kissed willingly enough, though Maggie hung on
his neck in rather a strangling fashion, while his blue-gray eyes wandered
toward the croft and the lambs and the river, where he promised himself that he
would begin to fish the first thing to-morrow morning. He was one of those lads
that grow everywhere in England, and at twelve or thirteen years of age look as
much alike as goslings,&mdash;a lad with light-brown hair, cheeks of cream and
roses, full lips, indeterminate nose and eyebrows,&mdash;a physiognomy in which
it seems impossible to discern anything but the generic character to boyhood;
as different as possible from poor Maggie&rsquo;s phiz, which Nature seemed to
have moulded and coloured with the most decided intention. But that same Nature
has the deep cunning which hides itself under the appearance of openness, so
that simple people think they can see through her quite well, and all the while
she is secretly preparing a refutation of their confident prophecies. Under
these average boyish physiognomies that she seems to turn off by the gross, she
conceals some of her most rigid, inflexible purposes, some of her most
unmodifiable characters; and the dark-eyed, demonstrative, rebellious girl may
after all turn out to be a passive being compared with this pink-and-white bit
of masculinity with the indeterminate features.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom, confidentially, taking her into a corner, as
soon as his mother was gone out to examine his box and the warm parlour had
taken off the chill he had felt from the long drive, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
know what I&rsquo;ve got in <i>my</i> pockets,&rdquo; nodding his head up and
down as a means of rousing her sense of mystery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;How stodgy they look, Tom! Is it marls
(marbles) or cobnuts?&rdquo; Maggie&rsquo;s heart sank a little, because Tom
always said it was &ldquo;no good&rdquo; playing with <i>her</i> at those
games, she played so badly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marls! no; I&rsquo;ve swopped all my marls with the little fellows, and
cobnuts are no fun, you silly, only when the nuts are green. But see
here!&rdquo; He drew something half out of his right-hand pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Maggie, in a whisper. &ldquo;I can see nothing
but a bit of yellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s&mdash;a&mdash;new&mdash;guess, Maggie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> guess, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a spitfire, else I won&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said Tom,
thrusting his hand back into his pocket and looking determined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, imploringly, laying hold of the arm that
was held stiffly in the pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not cross, Tom; it was only
because I can&rsquo;t bear guessing. <i>Please</i> be good to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom&rsquo;s arm slowly relaxed, and he said, &ldquo;Well, then, it&rsquo;s a
new fish-line&mdash;two new uns,&mdash;one for you, Maggie, all to yourself. I
wouldn&rsquo;t go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the
money; and Gibson and Spouncer fought with me because I wouldn&rsquo;t. And
here&rsquo;s hooks; see here&mdash;I say, <i>won&rsquo;t</i> we go and fish
to-morrow down by the Round Pool? And you shall catch your own fish, Maggie and
put the worms on, and everything; won&rsquo;t it be fun?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s answer was to throw her arms round Tom&rsquo;s neck and hug him,
and hold her cheek against his without speaking, while he slowly unwound some
of the line, saying, after a pause,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I a good brother, now, to buy you a line all to yourself?
You know, I needn&rsquo;t have bought it, if I hadn&rsquo;t liked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very, very good&mdash;I <i>do</i> love you, Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom had put the line back in his pocket, and was looking at the hooks one by
one, before he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the fellows fought me, because I wouldn&rsquo;t give in about the
toffee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear! I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t fight at your school, Tom.
Didn&rsquo;t it hurt you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurt me? no,&rdquo; said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a
large pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at
meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I gave Spouncer a black eye, I know; that&rsquo;s what he got by wanting
to leather <i>me;</i> I wasn&rsquo;t going to go halves because anybody
leathered me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how brave you are, Tom! I think you&rsquo;re like Samson. If there
came a lion roaring at me, I think you&rsquo;d fight him, wouldn&rsquo;t you,
Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There&rsquo;s no
lions, only in the shows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; but if we were in the lion countries&mdash;I mean in Africa, where
it&rsquo;s very hot; the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book
where I read it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you hadn&rsquo;t got a gun,&mdash;we might have gone out, you
know, not thinking, just as we go fishing; and then a great lion might run
towards us roaring, and we couldn&rsquo;t get away from him. What should you
do, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying, &ldquo;But the lion
<i>isn&rsquo;t</i> coming. What&rsquo;s the use of talking?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I like to fancy how it would be,&rdquo; said Maggie, following him.
&ldquo;Just think what you would do, Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother, Maggie! you&rsquo;re such a silly. I shall go
and see my rabbits.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s heart began to flutter with fear. She dared not tell the sad
truth at once, but she walked after Tom in trembling silence as he went out,
thinking how she could tell him the news so as to soften at once his sorrow and
his anger; for Maggie dreaded Tom&rsquo;s anger of all things; it was quite a
different anger from her own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said, timidly, when they were out of doors, &ldquo;how
much money did you give for your rabbits?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two half-crowns and a sixpence,&rdquo; said Tom, promptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got a great deal more than that in my steel purse
upstairs. I&rsquo;ll ask mother to give it you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want <i>your</i> money,
you silly thing. I&rsquo;ve got a great deal more money than you, because
I&rsquo;m a boy. I always have half-sovereigns and sovereigns for my Christmas
boxes because I shall be a man, and you only have five-shilling pieces, because
you&rsquo;re only a girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but, Tom&mdash;if mother would let me give you two half-crowns and
a sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend, you know, and buy
some more rabbits with it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More rabbits? I don&rsquo;t want any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but, Tom, they&rsquo;re all dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom stopped immediately in his walk and turned round toward Maggie. &ldquo;You
forgot to feed &rsquo;em, then, and Harry forgot?&rdquo; he said, his colour
heightening for a moment, but soon subsiding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pitch into
Harry. I&rsquo;ll have him turned away. And I don&rsquo;t love you, Maggie. You
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go fishing with me to-morrow. I told you to go and see the
rabbits every day.&rdquo; He walked on again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I forgot&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t help it, indeed, Tom.
I&rsquo;m so very sorry,&rdquo; said Maggie, while the tears rushed fast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a naughty girl,&rdquo; said Tom, severely, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m sorry I bought you the fish-line. I don&rsquo;t love you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom, it&rsquo;s very cruel,&rdquo; sobbed Maggie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
forgive you, if <i>you</i> forgot anything&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind what you
did&mdash;I&rsquo;d forgive you and love you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re silly; but I never <i>do</i> forget things, <i>I</i>
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, please forgive me, Tom; my heart will break,&rdquo; said Maggie,
shaking with sobs, clinging to Tom&rsquo;s arm, and laying her wet cheek on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Tom shook her off, and stopped again, saying in a peremptory tone, &ldquo;Now,
Maggie, you just listen. Aren&rsquo;t I a good brother to you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye-ye-es,&rdquo; sobbed Maggie, her chin rising and falling convulsedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I think about your fish-line all this quarter, and mean to
buy it, and saved my money o&rsquo; purpose, and wouldn&rsquo;t go halves in
the toffee, and Spouncer fought me because I wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye-ye-es&mdash;and I&mdash;lo-lo-love you so, Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a naughty girl. Last holidays you licked the paint off
my lozenge-box, and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my fish-line
down when I&rsquo;d set you to watch it, and you pushed your head through my
kite, all for nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
help it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you could,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d minded what you
were doing. And you&rsquo;re a naughty girl, and you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go
fishing with me to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this terrible conclusion, Tom ran away from Maggie toward the mill,
meaning to greet Luke there, and complain to him of Harry.
</p>

<p>
Maggie stood motionless, except from her sobs, for a minute or two; then she
turned round and ran into the house, and up to her attic, where she sat on the
floor and laid her head against the worm-eaten shelf, with a crushing sense of
misery. Tom was come home, and she had thought how happy she should be; and now
he was cruel to her. What use was anything if Tom didn&rsquo;t love her? Oh, he
was very cruel! Hadn&rsquo;t she wanted to give him the money, and said how
very sorry she was? She knew she was naughty to her mother, but she had never
been naughty to Tom&mdash;had never <i>meant</i> to be naughty to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he is cruel!&rdquo; Maggie sobbed aloud, finding a wretched pleasure
in the hollow resonance that came through the long empty space of the attic.
She never thought of beating or grinding her Fetish; she was too miserable to
be angry.
</p>

<p>
These bitter sorrows of childhood! when sorrow is all new and strange, when
hope has not yet got wings to fly beyond the days and weeks, and the space from
summer to summer seems measureless.
</p>

<p>
Maggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic, and it must be tea-time,
and they were all having their tea, and not thinking of her. Well, then, she
would stay up there and starve herself,&mdash;hide herself behind the tub, and
stay there all night,&mdash;and then they would all be frightened, and Tom
would be sorry. Thus Maggie thought in the pride of her heart, as she crept
behind the tub; but presently she began to cry again at the idea that they
didn&rsquo;t mind her being there. If she went down again to Tom
now&mdash;would he forgive her? Perhaps her father would be there, and he would
take her part. But then she wanted Tom to forgive her because he loved her, not
because his father told him. No, she would never go down if Tom didn&rsquo;t
come to fetch her. This resolution lasted in great intensity for five dark
minutes behind the tub; but then the need of being loved&mdash;the strongest
need in poor Maggie&rsquo;s nature&mdash;began to wrestle with her pride, and
soon threw it. She crept from behind her tub into the twilight of the long
attic, but just then she heard a quick foot-step on the stairs.
</p>

<p>
Tom had been too much interested in his talk with Luke, in going the round of
the premises, walking in and out where he pleased, and whittling sticks without
any particular reason,&mdash;except that he didn&rsquo;t whittle sticks at
school,&mdash;to think of Maggie and the effect his anger had produced on her.
He meant to punish her, and that business having been performed, he occupied
himself with other matters, like a practical person. But when he had been
called in to tea, his father said, &ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s the little
wench?&rdquo; and Mrs Tulliver, almost at the same moment, said,
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your little sister?&rdquo;&mdash;both of them having
supposed that Maggie and Tom had been together all the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tom. He didn&rsquo;t want to
&ldquo;tell&rdquo; of Maggie, though he was angry with her; for Tom Tulliver
was a lad of honour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! hasn&rsquo;t she been playing with you all this while?&rdquo; said
the father. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d been thinking o&rsquo; nothing but your coming
home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her this two hours,&rdquo; says Tom, commencing on
the plumcake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goodness heart; she&rsquo;s got drownded!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs
Tulliver, rising from her seat and running to the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How could you let her do so?&rdquo; she added, as became a fearful
woman, accusing she didn&rsquo;t know whom of she didn&rsquo;t know what.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, nay, she&rsquo;s none drownded,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been naughty to her, I doubt, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t, father,&rdquo; said Tom, indignantly.
&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s in the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps up in that attic,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, &ldquo;a-singing
and talking to herself, and forgetting all about meal-times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You go and fetch her down, Tom,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, rather
sharply,&mdash;his perspicacity or his fatherly fondness for Maggie making him
suspect that the lad had been hard upon &ldquo;the little un,&rdquo; else she
would never have left his side. &ldquo;And be good to her, do you hear? Else
I&rsquo;ll let you know better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom never disobeyed his father, for Mr Tulliver was a peremptory man, and, as
he said, would never let anybody get hold of his whip-hand; but he went out
rather sullenly, carrying his piece of plumcake, and not intending to reprieve
Maggie&rsquo;s punishment, which was no more than she deserved. Tom was only
thirteen, and had no decided views in grammar and arithmetic, regarding them
for the most part as open questions, but he was particularly clear and positive
on one point,&mdash;namely, that he would punish everybody who deserved it.
Why, he wouldn&rsquo;t have minded being punished himself if he deserved it;
but, then, he never <i>did</i> deserve it.
</p>

<p>
It was Tom&rsquo;s step, then, that Maggie heard on the stairs, when her need
of love had triumphed over her pride, and she was going down with her swollen
eyes and dishevelled hair to beg for pity. At least her father would stroke her
head and say, &ldquo;Never mind, my wench.&rdquo; It is a wonderful subduer,
this need of love,&mdash;this hunger of the heart,&mdash;as peremptory as that
other hunger by which Nature forces us to submit to the yoke, and change the
face of the world.
</p>

<p>
But she knew Tom&rsquo;s step, and her heart began to beat violently with the
sudden shock of hope. He only stood still at the top of the stairs and said,
&ldquo;Maggie, you&rsquo;re to come down.&rdquo; But she rushed to him and
clung round his neck, sobbing, &ldquo;Oh, Tom, please forgive me&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;I will always be good&mdash;always remember
things&mdash;do love me&mdash;please, dear Tom!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We learn to restrain ourselves as we get older. We keep apart when we have
quarrelled, express ourselves in well-bred phrases, and in this way preserve a
dignified alienation, showing much firmness on one side, and swallowing much
grief on the other. We no longer approximate in our behaviour to the mere
impulsiveness of the lower animals, but conduct ourselves in every respect like
members of a highly civilised society. Maggie and Tom were still very much like
young animals, and so she could rub her cheek against his, and kiss his ear in
a random sobbing way; and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been
used to answer to Maggie&rsquo;s fondling, so that he behaved with a weakness
quite inconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved.
He actually began to kiss her in return, and say,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, then, Magsie; here, eat a bit o&rsquo; cake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s sobs began to subside, and she put out her mouth for the cake
and bit a piece; and then Tom bit a piece, just for company, and they ate
together and rubbed each other&rsquo;s cheeks and brows and noses together,
while they ate, with a humiliating resemblance to two friendly ponies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come along, Magsie, and have tea,&rdquo; said Tom at last, when there
was no more cake except what was down-stairs.
</p>

<p>
So ended the sorrows of this day, and the next morning Maggie was trotting with
her own fishing-rod in one hand and a handle of the basket in the other,
stepping always, by a peculiar gift, in the muddiest places, and looking darkly
radiant from under her beaver-bonnet because Tom was good to her. She had told
Tom, however, that she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her,
although she accepted his word when he assured her that worms couldn&rsquo;t
feel (it was Tom&rsquo;s private opinion that it didn&rsquo;t much matter if
they did). He knew all about worms, and fish, and those things; and what birds
were mischievous, and how padlocks opened, and which way the handles of the
gates were to be lifted. Maggie thought this sort of knowledge was very
wonderful,&mdash;much more difficult than remembering what was in the books;
and she was rather in awe of Tom&rsquo;s superiority, for he was the only
person who called her knowledge &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; and did not feel surprised
at her cleverness. Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie was a silly little
thing; all girls were silly,&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t throw a stone so as to
hit anything, couldn&rsquo;t do anything with a pocket-knife, and were
frightened at frogs. Still, he was very fond of his sister, and meant always to
take care of her, make her his housekeeper, and punish her when she did wrong.
</p>

<p>
They were on their way to the Round Pool,&mdash;that wonderful pool, which the
floods had made a long while ago. No one knew how deep it was; and it was
mysterious, too, that it should be almost a perfect round, framed in with
willows and tall reeds, so that the water was only to be seen when you got
close to the brink. The sight of the old favourite spot always heightened
Tom&rsquo;s good humour, and he spoke to Maggie in the most amicable whispers,
as he opened the precious basket and prepared their tackle. He threw her line
for her, and put the rod into her hand. Maggie thought it probable that the
small fish would come to her hook, and the large ones to Tom&rsquo;s. But she
had forgotten all about the fish, and was looking dreamily at the glassy water,
when Tom said, in a loud whisper, &ldquo;Look, look, Maggie!&rdquo; and came
running to prevent her from snatching her line away.
</p>

<p>
Maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong, as usual, but
presently Tom drew out her line and brought a large tench bouncing on the
grass.
</p>

<p>
Tom was excited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Magsie, you little duck! Empty the basket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was not conscious of unusual merit, but it was enough that Tom called
her Magsie, and was pleased with her. There was nothing to mar her delight in
the whispers and the dreamy silences, when she listened to the light dripping
sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle rustling, as if the willows and the
reeds and the water had their happy whisperings also. Maggie thought it would
make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that way, and never be scolded.
She never knew she had a bite till Tom told her; but she liked fishing very
much.
</p>

<p>
It was one of their happy mornings. They trotted along and sat down together,
with no thought that life would ever change much for them; they would only get
bigger and not go to school, and it would always be like the holidays; they
would always live together and be fond of each other. And the mill with its
booming; the great chestnut-tree under which they played at houses; their own
little river, the Ripple, where the banks seemed like home, and Tom was always
seeing the water-rats, while Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the
reeds, which she forgot and dropped afterward; above all, the great Floss,
along which they wandered with a sense of travel, to see the rushing
spring-tide, the awful Eagre, come up like a hungry monster, or to see the
Great Ash which had once wailed and groaned like a man, these things would
always be just the same to them. Tom thought people were at a disadvantage who
lived on any other spot of the globe; and Maggie, when she read about
Christiana passing &ldquo;the river over which there is no bridge,&rdquo;
always saw the Floss between the green pastures by the Great Ash.
</p>

<p>
Life did change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they were not wrong in believing
that the thoughts and loves of these first years would always make part of
their lives. We could never have loved the earth so well if we had had no
childhood in it,&mdash;if it were not the earth where the same flowers come up
again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat
lisping to ourselves on the grass; the same hips and haws on the autumn&rsquo;s
hedgerows; the same redbreasts that we used to call &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
birds,&rdquo; because they did no harm to the precious crops. What novelty is
worth that sweet monotony where everything is known, and <i>loved</i> because
it is known?
</p>

<p>
The wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the young yellow-brown foliage of
the oaks between me and the blue sky, the white star-flowers and the blue-eyed
speedwell and the ground ivy at my feet, what grove of tropic palms, what
strange ferns or splendid broad-petalled blossoms, could ever thrill such deep
and delicate fibres within me as this home scene? These familiar flowers, these
well-remembered bird-notes, this sky, with its fitful brightness, these
furrowed and grassy fields, each with a sort of personality given to it by the
capricious hedgerows,&mdash;such things as these are the mother-tongue of our
imagination, the language that is laden with all the subtle, inextricable
associations the fleeting hours of our childhood left behind them. Our delight
in the sunshine on the deep-bladed grass to-day might be no more than the faint
perception of wearied souls, if it were not for the sunshine and the grass in
the far-off years which still live in us, and transform our perception into
love.

The Aunts and Uncles Are Coming</h3>

<p>
It was Easter week, and Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s cheesecakes were more exquisitely
light than usual. &ldquo;A puff o&rsquo; wind &rsquo;ud make &rsquo;em blow
about like feathers,&rdquo; Kezia the housemaid said, feeling proud to live
under a mistress who could make such pastry; so that no season or circumstances
could have been more propitious for a family party, even if it had not been
advisable to consult sister Glegg and sister Pullet about Tom&rsquo;s going to
school.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d as lief not invite sister Deane this time,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, &ldquo;for she&rsquo;s as jealous and having as can be, and&rsquo;s
allays trying to make the worst o&rsquo; my poor children to their aunts and
uncles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;ask her to come. I never
hardly get a bit o&rsquo; talk with Deane now; we haven&rsquo;t had him this
six months. What&rsquo;s it matter what she says? My children need be beholding
to nobody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you allays say, Mr Tulliver; but I&rsquo;m sure
there&rsquo;s nobody o&rsquo; <i>your</i> side, neither aunt nor uncle, to
leave &rsquo;em so much as a five-pound note for a leggicy. And there&rsquo;s
sister Glegg, and sister Pullet too, saving money unknown, for they put by all
their own interest and butter-money too; their husbands buy &rsquo;em
everything.&rdquo; Mrs Tulliver was a mild woman, but even a sheep will face
about a little when she has lambs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tchuh!&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver. &ldquo;It takes a big loaf when
there&rsquo;s many to breakfast. What signifies your sisters&rsquo; bits
o&rsquo; money when they&rsquo;ve got half-a-dozen nevvies and nieces to divide
it among? And your sister Deane won&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em to leave all to one,
I reckon, and make the country cry shame on &rsquo;em when they are
dead?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she won&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em to do,&rdquo; said
Mrs Tulliver, &ldquo;for my children are so awk&rsquo;ard wi&rsquo; their
aunts and uncles. Maggie&rsquo;s ten times naughtier when they come than she is
other days, and Tom doesn&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em, bless him!&mdash;though
it&rsquo;s more nat&rsquo;ral in a boy than a gell. And there&rsquo;s Lucy
Deane&rsquo;s such a good child,&mdash;you may set her on a stool, and there
she&rsquo;ll sit for an hour together, and never offer to get off. I
can&rsquo;t help loving the child as if she was my own; and I&rsquo;m sure
she&rsquo;s more like <i>my</i> child than sister Deane&rsquo;s, for
she&rsquo;d allays a very poor colour for one of our family, sister Deane
had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, if you&rsquo;re fond o&rsquo; the child, ask her father and
mother to bring her with &rsquo;em. And won&rsquo;t you ask their aunt and
uncle Moss too, and some o&rsquo; <i>their</i> children?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, Mr Tulliver, why, there&rsquo;d be eight people besides the
children, and I must put two more leaves i&rsquo; the table, besides reaching
down more o&rsquo; the dinner-service; and you know as well as I do as
<i>my</i> sisters and <i>your</i> sister don&rsquo;t suit well together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, do as you like, Bessy,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, taking up
his hat and walking out to the mill. Few wives were more submissive than Mrs
Tulliver on all points unconnected with her family relations; but she had been
a Miss Dodson, and the Dodsons were a very respectable family indeed,&mdash;as
much looked up to as any in their own parish, or the next to it. The Miss
Dodsons had always been thought to hold up their heads very high, and no one
was surprised the two eldest had married so well,&mdash;not at an early age,
for that was not the practice of the Dodson family. There were particular ways
of doing everything in that family: particular ways of bleaching the linen, of
making the cowslip wine, curing the hams, and keeping the bottled gooseberries;
so that no daughter of that house could be indifferent to the privilege of
having been born a Dodson, rather than a Gibson or a Watson. Funerals were
always conducted with peculiar propriety in the Dodson family: the hat-bands
were never of a blue shade, the gloves never split at the thumb, everybody was
a mourner who ought to be, and there were always scarfs for the bearers. When
one of the family was in trouble or sickness, all the rest went to visit the
unfortunate member, usually at the same time, and did not shrink from uttering
the most disagreeable truths that correct family feeling dictated; if the
illness or trouble was the sufferer&rsquo;s own fault, it was not in the
practice of the Dodson family to shrink from saying so. In short, there was in
this family a peculiar tradition as to what was the right thing in household
management and social demeanour, and the only bitter circumstance attending
this superiority was a painful inability to approve the condiments or the
conduct of families ungoverned by the Dodson tradition. A female Dodson, when
in &ldquo;strange houses,&rdquo; always ate dry bread with her tea, and
declined any sort of preserves, having no confidence in the butter, and
thinking that the preserves had probably begun to ferment from want of due
sugar and boiling. There were some Dodsons less like the family than others,
that was admitted; but in so far as they were &ldquo;kin,&rdquo; they were of
necessity better than those who were &ldquo;no kin.&rdquo; And it is remarkable
that while no individual Dodson was satisfied with any other individual Dodson,
each was satisfied, not only with him or herself, but with the Dodsons
collectively. The feeblest member of a family&mdash;the one who has the least
character&mdash;is often the merest epitome of the family habits and
traditions; and Mrs Tulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild one, as
small-beer, so long as it is anything, is only describable as very weak ale:
and though she had groaned a little in her youth under the yoke of her elder
sisters, and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly reproaches, it was
not in Mrs Tulliver to be an innovator on the family ideas. She was thankful to
have been a Dodson, and to have one child who took after her own family, at
least in his features and complexion, in liking salt and in eating beans, which
a Tulliver never did.
</p>

<p>
In other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom, and he was as far
from appreciating his &ldquo;kin&rdquo; on the mother&rsquo;s side as Maggie
herself, generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the most
portable food, when he received timely warning that his aunts and uncles were
coming,&mdash;a moral symptom from which his aunt Glegg deduced the gloomiest
views of his future. It was rather hard on Maggie that Tom always absconded
without letting her into the secret, but the weaker sex are acknowledged to be
serious <i>impedimenta</i> in cases of flight.
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday, the day before the aunts and uncles were coming, there were such
various and suggestive scents, as of plumcakes in the oven and jellies in the
hot state, mingled with the aroma of gravy, that it was impossible to feel
altogether gloomy: there was hope in the air. Tom and Maggie made several
inroads into the kitchen, and, like other marauders, were induced to keep aloof
for a time only by being allowed to carry away a sufficient load of booty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, as they sat on the boughs of the elder-tree,
eating their jam-puffs, &ldquo;shall you run away to-morrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, slowly, when he had finished his puff, and was
eying the third, which was to be divided between them,&mdash;&ldquo;no, I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Tom? Because Lucy&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, opening his pocket-knife and holding it over the
puff, with his head on one side in a dubitative manner. (It was a difficult
problem to divide that very irregular polygon into two equal parts.)
&ldquo;What do <i>I</i> care about Lucy? She&rsquo;s only a
girl,&mdash;<i>she</i> can&rsquo;t play at bandy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it the tipsy-cake, then?&rdquo; said Maggie, exerting her hypothetic
powers, while she leaned forward toward Tom with her eyes fixed on the hovering
knife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you silly, that&rsquo;ll be good the day after. It&rsquo;s the
pudden. I know what the pudden&rsquo;s to be,&mdash;apricot roll-up&mdash;O my
buttons!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this interjection, the knife descended on the puff, and it was in two, but
the result was not satisfactory to Tom, for he still eyed the halves
doubtfully. At last he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shut your eyes, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never mind what for. Shut &rsquo;em when I tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie obeyed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, which&rsquo;ll you have, Maggie,&mdash;right hand or left?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that with the jam run out,&rdquo; said Maggie, keeping
her eyes shut to please Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t like that, you silly. You may have it if it comes
to you fair, but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t give it you without. Right or
left,&mdash;you choose, now. Ha-a-a!&rdquo; said Tom, in a tone of
exasperation, as Maggie peeped. &ldquo;You keep your eyes shut, now, else you
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have any.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s power of sacrifice did not extend so far; indeed, I fear she
cared less that Tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff, than that
he should be pleased with her for giving him the best bit. So she shut her eyes
quite close, till Tom told her to &ldquo;say which,&rdquo; and then she said,
&ldquo;Left hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; said Tom, in rather a bitter tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! the bit with the jam run out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; here, take it,&rdquo; said Tom, firmly, handing, decidedly the best
piece to Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, please, Tom, have it; I don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;I like the other;
please take this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom, almost crossly, beginning on
his own inferior piece.
</p>

<p>
Maggie, thinking it was no use to contend further, began too, and ate up her
half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity. But Tom had finished
first, and had to look on while Maggie ate her last morsel or two, feeling in
himself a capacity for more. Maggie didn&rsquo;t know Tom was looking at her;
she was seesawing on the elder-bough, lost to almost everything but a vague
sense of jam and idleness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you greedy thing!&rdquo; said Tom, when she had swallowed the last
morsel. He was conscious of having acted very fairly, and thought she ought to
have considered this, and made up to him for it. He would have refused a bit of
hers beforehand, but one is naturally at a different point of view before and
after one&rsquo;s own share of puff is swallowed.
</p>

<p>
Maggie turned quite pale. &ldquo;Oh, Tom, why didn&rsquo;t you ask me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> wasn&rsquo;t going to ask you for a bit, you greedy. You might
have thought of it without, when you knew I gave you the best bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I wanted you to have it; you know I did,&rdquo; said Maggie, in an
injured tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to do what wasn&rsquo;t fair, like
Spouncer. He always takes the best bit, if you don&rsquo;t punch him for it;
and if you choose the best with your eyes shut, he changes his hands. But if I
go halves, I&rsquo;ll go &rsquo;em fair; only I wouldn&rsquo;t be a
greedy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this cutting innuendo, Tom jumped down from his bough, and threw a stone
with a &ldquo;hoigh!&rdquo; as a friendly attention to Yap, who had also been
looking on while the eatables vanished, with an agitation of his ears and
feelings which could hardly have been without bitterness. Yet the excellent dog
accepted Tom&rsquo;s attention with as much alacrity as if he had been treated
quite generously.
</p>

<p>
But Maggie, gifted with that superior power of misery which distinguishes the
human being, and places him at a proud distance from the most melancholy
chimpanzee, sat still on her bough, and gave herself up to the keen sense of
unmerited reproach. She would have given the world not to have eaten all her
puff, and to have saved some of it for Tom. Not but that the puff was very
nice, for Maggie&rsquo;s palate was not at all obtuse, but she would have gone
without it many times over, sooner than Tom should call her greedy and be cross
with her. And he had said he wouldn&rsquo;t have it, and she ate it without
thinking; how could she help it? The tears flowed so plentifully that Maggie
saw nothing around her for the next ten minutes; but by that time resentment
began to give way to the desire of reconciliation, and she jumped from her
bough to look for Tom. He was no longer in the paddock behind the rickyard;
where was he likely to be gone, and Yap with him? Maggie ran to the high bank
against the great holly-tree, where she could see far away toward the Floss.
There was Tom; but her heart sank again as she saw how far off he was on his
way to the great river, and that he had another companion besides
Yap,&mdash;naughty Bob Jakin, whose official, if not natural, function of
frightening the birds was just now at a standstill. Maggie felt sure that Bob
was wicked, without very distinctly knowing why; unless it was because
Bob&rsquo;s mother was a dreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer round
house down the river; and once, when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither, there
rushed out a brindled dog that wouldn&rsquo;t stop barking; and when
Bob&rsquo;s mother came out after it, and screamed above the barking to tell
them not to be frightened, Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely, and
her heart beat with terror. Maggie thought it very likely that the round house
had snakes on the floor, and bats in the bedroom; for she had seen Bob take off
his cap to show Tom a little snake that was inside it, and another time he had
a handful of young bats: altogether, he was an irregular character, perhaps
even slightly diabolical, judging from his intimacy with snakes and bats; and
to crown all, when Tom had Bob for a companion, he didn&rsquo;t mind about
Maggie, and would never let her go with him.
</p>

<p>
It must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob&rsquo;s company. How could it be
otherwise? Bob knew, directly he saw a bird&rsquo;s egg, whether it was a
swallow&rsquo;s, or a tomtit&rsquo;s, or a yellow-hammer&rsquo;s; he found out
all the wasps&rsquo; nests, and could set all sort of traps; he could climb the
trees like a squirrel, and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs and
stoats; and he had courage to do things that were rather naughty, such as
making gaps in the hedgerows, throwing stones after the sheep, and killing a
cat that was wandering <i>incognito</i>. Such qualities in an inferior, who
could always be treated with authority in spite of his superior knowingness,
had necessarily a fatal fascination for Tom; and every holiday-time Maggie was
sure to have days of grief because he had gone off with Bob.
</p>

<p>
Well! there was no hope for it; he was gone now, and Maggie could think of no
comfort but to sit down by the hollow, or wander by the hedgerow, and fancy it
was all different, refashioning her little world into just what she should like
it to be.
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s was a troublous life, and this was the form in which she took
her opium.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Tom, forgetting all about Maggie and the sting of reproach which he
had left in her heart, was hurrying along with Bob, whom he had met
accidentally, to the scene of a great rat-catching in a neighbouring barn. Bob
knew all about this particular affair, and spoke of the sport with an
enthusiasm which no one who is not either divested of all manly feeling, or
pitiably ignorant of rat-catching, can fail to imagine. For a person suspected
of preternatural wickedness, Bob was really not so very villanous-looking;
there was even something agreeable in his snub-nosed face, with its
close-curled border of red hair. But then his trousers were always rolled up at
the knee, for the convenience of wading on the slightest notice; and his
virtue, supposing it to exist, was undeniably &ldquo;virtue in rags,&rdquo;
which, on the authority even of bilious philosophers, who think all
well-dressed merit overpaid, is notoriously likely to remain unrecognised
(perhaps because it is seen so seldom).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know the chap as owns the ferrets,&rdquo; said Bob, in a hoarse treble
voice, as he shuffled along, keeping his blue eyes fixed on the river, like an
amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for darting in. &ldquo;He lives up the
Kennel Yard at Sut Ogg&rsquo;s, he does. He&rsquo;s the biggest rot-catcher
anywhere, he is. I&rsquo;d sooner, be a rot-catcher nor anything, I would. The
moles is nothing to the rots. But Lors! you mun ha&rsquo; ferrets. Dogs is no
good. Why, there&rsquo;s that dog, now!&rdquo; Bob continued, pointing with an
air of disgust toward Yap, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s no more good wi&rsquo; a rot nor
nothin&rsquo;. I see it myself, I did, at the rot-catchin&rsquo; i&rsquo; your
feyther&rsquo;s barn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yap, feeling the withering influence of this scorn, tucked his tail in and
shrank close to Tom&rsquo;s leg, who felt a little hurt for him, but had not
the superhuman courage to seem behindhand with Bob in contempt for a dog who
made so poor a figure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Yap&rsquo;s no good at sport. I&rsquo;ll
have regular good dogs for rats and everything, when I&rsquo;ve done
school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hev ferrets, Measter Tom,&rdquo; said Bob, eagerly,&mdash;&ldquo;them
white ferrets wi&rsquo; pink eyes; Lors, you might catch your own rots,
an&rsquo; you might put a rot in a cage wi&rsquo; a ferret, an&rsquo; see
&rsquo;em fight, you might. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do, I know, an&rsquo;
it &rsquo;ud be better fun a&rsquo;most nor seein&rsquo; two chaps
fight,&mdash;if it wasn&rsquo;t them chaps as sold cakes an&rsquo; oranges at
the Fair, as the things flew out o&rsquo; their baskets, an&rsquo; some
o&rsquo; the cakes was smashed&mdash;But they tasted just as good,&rdquo; added
Bob, by way of note or addendum, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, I say, Bob,&rdquo; said Tom, in a tone of deliberation,
&ldquo;ferrets are nasty biting things,&mdash;they&rsquo;ll bite a fellow
without being set on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lors! why that&rsquo;s the beauty on &rsquo;em. If a chap lays hold
o&rsquo; your ferret, he won&rsquo;t be long before he hollows out a good un,
<i>he</i> won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment a striking incident made the boys pause suddenly in their walk.
It was the plunging of some small body in the water from among the neighbouring
bulrushes; if it was not a water-rat, Bob intimated that he was ready to
undergo the most unpleasant consequences.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hoigh! Yap,&mdash;hoigh! there he is,&rdquo; said Tom, clapping his
hands, as the little black snout made its arrowy course to the opposite bank.
&ldquo;Seize him, lad! seize him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yap agitated his ears and wrinkled his brows, but declined to plunge, trying
whether barking would not answer the purpose just as well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ugh! you coward!&rdquo; said Tom, and kicked him over, feeling
humiliated as a sportsman to possess so poor-spirited an animal. Bob abstained
from remark and passed on, choosing, however, to walk in the shallow edge of
the overflowing river by way of change.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s none so full now, the Floss isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bob, as
he kicked the water up before him, with an agreeable sense of being insolent to
it. &ldquo;Why, last &rsquo;ear, the meadows was all one sheet o&rsquo; water,
they was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but,&rdquo; said Tom, whose mind was prone to see an opposition
between statements that were really accordant,&mdash;&ldquo;but there was a big
flood once, when the Round Pool was made. <i>I</i> know there was, &rsquo;cause
father says so. And the sheep and cows all drowned, and the boats went all over
the fields ever such a way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t care about a flood comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bob;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the water, no more nor the land. I&rsquo;d swim,
<i>I</i> would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?&rdquo; said Tom, his
imagination becoming quite active under the stimulus of that dread. &ldquo;When
I&rsquo;m a man, I shall make a boat with a wooden house on the top of it, like
Noah&rsquo;s ark, and keep plenty to eat in it,&mdash;rabbits and
things,&mdash;all ready. And then if the flood came, you know, Bob, I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind. And I&rsquo;d take you in, if I saw you swimming,&rdquo;
he added, in the tone of a benevolent patron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I aren&rsquo;t frighted,&rdquo; said Bob, to whom hunger did not appear
so appalling. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d get in an&rsquo; knock the rabbits on
th&rsquo; head when you wanted to eat &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, and I should have halfpence, and we&rsquo;d play at
heads-and-tails,&rdquo; said Tom, not contemplating the possibility that this
recreation might have fewer charms for his mature age. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d divide
fair to begin with, and then we&rsquo;d see who&rsquo;d win.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a halfpenny o&rsquo; my own,&rdquo; said Bob, proudly,
coming out of the water and tossing his halfpenny in the air. &ldquo;Yeads or
tails?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tails,&rdquo; said Tom, instantly fired with the desire to win.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yeads,&rdquo; said Bob, hastily, snatching up the halfpenny
as it fell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom, loudly and peremptorily. &ldquo;You
give me the halfpenny; I&rsquo;ve won it fair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bob, holding it tight in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make you; see if I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make me do nothing, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m master.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll make you care, you cheat,&rdquo; said Tom, collaring Bob
and shaking him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You get out wi&rsquo; you,&rdquo; said Bob, giving Tom a kick.
</p>

<p>
Tom&rsquo;s blood was thoroughly up: he went at Bob with a lunge and threw him
down, but Bob seized hold and kept it like a cat, and pulled Tom down after
him. They struggled fiercely on the ground for a moment or two, till Tom,
pinning Bob down by the shoulders, thought he had the mastery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i>, say you&rsquo;ll give me the halfpenny now,&rdquo; he said,
with difficulty, while he exerted himself to keep the command of Bob&rsquo;s
arms.
</p>

<p>
But at this moment Yap, who had been running on before, returned barking to the
scene of action, and saw a favourable opportunity for biting Bob&rsquo;s bare
leg not only with inpunity but with honour. The pain from Yap&rsquo;s teeth,
instead of surprising Bob into a relaxation of his hold, gave it a fiercer
tenacity, and with a new exertion of his force he pushed Tom backward and got
uppermost. But now Yap, who could get no sufficient purchase before, set his
teeth in a new place, so that Bob, harassed in this way, let go his hold of
Tom, and, almost throttling Yap, flung him into the river. By this time Tom was
up again, and before Bob had quite recovered his balance after the act of
swinging Yap, Tom fell upon him, threw him down, and got his knees firmly on
Bob&rsquo;s chest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You give me the halfpenny now,&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; said Bob, sulkily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t take it; you give it me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob took the halfpenny out of his pocket, and threw it away from him on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Tom loosed his hold, and left Bob to rise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There the halfpenny lies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your
halfpenny; I wouldn&rsquo;t have kept it. But you wanted to cheat; I hate a
cheat. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go along with you any more,&rdquo; he added,
turning round homeward, not without casting a regret toward the rat-catching
and other pleasures which he must relinquish along with Bob&rsquo;s society.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may let it alone, then,&rdquo; Bob called out after him. &ldquo;I
shall cheat if I like; there&rsquo;s no fun i&rsquo; playing else; and I know
where there&rsquo;s a goldfinch&rsquo;s nest, but I&rsquo;ll take care
<i>you</i> don&rsquo;t. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re a nasty fightin&rsquo;
turkey-cock, you are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom walked on without looking around, and Yap followed his example, the cold
bath having moderated his passions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go along wi&rsquo; you, then, wi&rsquo; your drowned dog; I
wouldn&rsquo;t own such a dog&mdash;<i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bob,
getting louder, in a last effort to sustain his defiance. But Tom was not to be
provoked into turning round, and Bob&rsquo;s voice began to falter a little as
he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;n gi&rsquo;en you everything, an&rsquo; showed you
everything, an&rsquo; niver wanted nothin&rsquo; from you. An&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s your horn-handed knife, then as you gi&rsquo;en me.&rdquo; Here
Bob flung the knife as far as he could after Tom&rsquo;s retreating footsteps.
But it produced no effect, except the sense in Bob&rsquo;s mind that there was
a terrible void in his lot, now that knife was gone.
</p>

<p>
He stood still till Tom had passed through the gate and disappeared behind the
hedge. The knife would do not good on the ground there; it wouldn&rsquo;t vex
Tom; and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in Bob&rsquo;s mind compared
with the love of a pocket-knife. His very fingers sent entreating thrills that
he would go and clutch that familiar rough buck&rsquo;s-horn handle, which they
had so often grasped for mere affection, as it lay idle in his pocket. And
there were two blades, and they had just been sharpened! What is life without a
pocket-knife to him who has once tasted a higher existence? No; to throw the
handle after the hatchet is a comprehensible act of desperation, but to throw
one&rsquo;s pocket-knife after an implacable friend is clearly in every sense a
hyperbole, or throwing beyond the mark. So Bob shuffled back to the spot where
the beloved knife lay in the dirt, and felt quite a new pleasure in clutching
it again after the temporary separation, in opening one blade after the other,
and feeling their edge with his well-hardened thumb. Poor Bob! he was not
sensitive on the point of honour, not a chivalrous character. That fine moral
aroma would not have been thought much of by the public opinion of Kennel Yard,
which was the very focus or heart of Bob&rsquo;s world, even if it could have
made itself perceptible there; yet, for all that, he was not utterly a sneak
and a thief as our friend Tom had hastily decided.
</p>

<p>
But Tom, you perceive, was rather a Rhadamanthine personage, having more than
the usual share of boy&rsquo;s justice in him,&mdash;the justice that desires
to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt, and is troubled with no
doubts concerning the exact amount of their deserts. Maggie saw a cloud on his
brow when he came home, which checked her joy at his coming so much sooner than
she had expected, and she dared hardly speak to him as he stood silently
throwing the small gravel-stones into the mill-dam. It is not pleasant to give
up a rat-catching when you have set your mind on it. But if Tom had told his
strongest feeling at that moment, he would have said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do just
the same again.&rdquo; That was his usual mode of viewing his past actions;
whereas Maggie was always wishing she had done something different.

Enter the Aunts and Uncles</h3>

<p>
The Dodsons were certainly a handsome family, and Mrs Glegg was not the least
handsome of the sisters. As she sat in Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s arm-chair, no
impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she had a very
comely face and figure, though Tom and Maggie considered their aunt Glegg as
the type of ugliness. It is true she despised the advantages of costume, for
though, as she often observed, no woman had better clothes, it was not her way
to wear her new things out before her old ones. Other women, if they liked,
might have their best thread-lace in every wash; but when Mrs Glegg died, it
would be found that she had better lace laid by in the right-hand drawer of her
wardrobe in the Spotted Chamber than ever Mrs Wooll of St Ogg&rsquo;s had
bought in her life, although Mrs Wooll wore her lace before it was paid for.
So of her curled fronts: Mrs Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and crispest
brown curls in her drawers, as well as curls in various degrees of fuzzy
laxness; but to look out on the week-day world from under a crisp and glossy
front would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between
the sacred and the secular. Occasionally, indeed, Mrs Glegg wore one of her
third-best fronts on a week-day visit, but not at a sister&rsquo;s house;
especially not at Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s, who, since her marriage, had hurt her
sister&rsquo;s feelings greatly by wearing her own hair, though, as Mrs Glegg
observed to Mrs Deane, a mother of a family, like Bessy, with a husband always
going to law, might have been expected to know better. But Bessy was always
weak!
</p>

<p>
So if Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s front to-day was more fuzzy and lax than usual, she had
a design under it: she intended the most pointed and cutting allusion to Mrs
Tulliver&rsquo;s bunches of blond curls, separated from each other by a due
wave of smoothness on each side of the parting. Mrs Tulliver had shed tears
several times at sister Glegg&rsquo;s unkindness on the subject of these
unmatronly curls, but the consciousness of looking the handsomer for them
naturally administered support. Mrs Glegg chose to wear her bonnet in the house
to-day,&mdash;untied and tilted slightly, of course&mdash;a frequent practice
of hers when she was on a visit, and happened to be in a severe humour: she
didn&rsquo;t know what draughts there might be in strange houses. For the same
reason she wore a small sable tippet, which reached just to her shoulders, and
was very far from meeting across her well-formed chest, while her long neck was
protected by a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of miscellaneous frilling. One would
need to be learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear
of them Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s slate-coloured silk gown must have been; but from
certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it, and a mouldy odor about
it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest, it was probable that it belonged to a
stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently into wear.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg held her large gold watch in her hand with the many-doubled chain
round her fingers, and observed to Mrs Tulliver, who had just returned from a
visit to the kitchen, that whatever it might be by other people&rsquo;s clocks
and watches, it was gone half-past twelve by hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what ails sister Pullet,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;It used to be the way in our family for one to be as early as
another,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it was so in my poor father&rsquo;s
time,&mdash;and not for one sister to sit half an hour before the others came.
But if the ways o&rsquo; the family are altered, it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
<i>my</i> fault; <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> never be the one to come into a house when
all the rest are going away. I wonder <i>at</i> sister Deane,&mdash;she used to
be more like me. But if you&rsquo;ll take my advice, Bessy, you&rsquo;ll put
the dinner forrard a bit, sooner than put it back, because folks are late as
ought to ha&rsquo; known better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, there&rsquo;s no fear but what they&rsquo;ll be all here in
time, sister,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, in her mild-peevish tone. &ldquo;The
dinner won&rsquo;t be ready till half-past one. But if it&rsquo;s long for you
to wait, let me fetch you a cheesecake and a glass o&rsquo; wine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bessy!&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, with a bitter smile and a scarcely
perceptible toss of her head, &ldquo;I should ha&rsquo; thought you&rsquo;d
known your own sister better. I never <i>did</i> eat between meals, and
I&rsquo;m not going to begin. Not but what I hate that nonsense of having your
dinner at half-past one, when you might have it at one. You was never brought
up in that way, Bessy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Jane, what can I do? Mr Tulliver doesn&rsquo;t like his dinner
before two o&rsquo;clock, but I put it half an hour earlier because o&rsquo;
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know how it is with husbands,&mdash;they&rsquo;re for
putting everything off; they&rsquo;ll put the dinner off till after tea, if
they&rsquo;ve got wives as are weak enough to give in to such work; but
it&rsquo;s a pity for you, Bessy, as you haven&rsquo;t got more strength
o&rsquo; mind. It&rsquo;ll be well if your children don&rsquo;t suffer for it.
And I hope you&rsquo;ve not gone and got a great dinner for us,&mdash;going to
expense for your sisters, as &rsquo;ud sooner eat a crust o&rsquo; dry bread
nor help to ruin you with extravagance. I wonder you don&rsquo;t take pattern
by your sister Deane; she&rsquo;s far more sensible. And here you&rsquo;ve got
two children to provide for, and your husband&rsquo;s spent your fortin
i&rsquo; going to law, and&rsquo;s likely to spend his own too. A boiled joint,
as you could make broth of for the kitchen,&rdquo; Mrs Glegg added, in a tone
of emphatic protest, &ldquo;and a plain pudding, with a spoonful o&rsquo;
sugar, and no spice, &rsquo;ud be far more becoming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With sister Glegg in this humour, there was a cheerful prospect for the day.
Mrs Tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her, any more than a
water-fowl that puts out its leg in a deprecating manner can be said to quarrel
with a boy who throws stones. But this point of the dinner was a tender one,
and not at all new, so that Mrs Tulliver could make the same answer she had
often made before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Tulliver says he always <i>will</i> have a good dinner for his
friends while he can pay for it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s a right
to do as he likes in his own house, sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bessy, <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t leave your children enough out
o&rsquo; my savings to keep &rsquo;em from ruin. And you mustn&rsquo;t look to
having any o&rsquo; Mr Glegg&rsquo;s money, for it&rsquo;s well if I
don&rsquo;t go first,&mdash;he comes of a long-lived family; and if he was to
die and leave me well for my life, he&rsquo;d tie all the money up to go back
to his own kin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sound of wheels while Mrs Glegg was speaking was an interruption highly
welcome to Mrs Tulliver, who hastened out to receive sister Pullet; it must be
sister Pullet, because the sound was that of a four-wheel.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg tossed her head and looked rather sour about the mouth at the
thought of the &ldquo;four-wheel.&rdquo; She had a strong opinion on that
subject.
</p>

<p>
Sister Pullet was in tears when the one-horse chaise stopped before Mrs
Tulliver&rsquo;s door, and it was apparently requisite that she should shed a
few more before getting out; for though her husband and Mrs Tulliver stood
ready to support her, she sat still and shook her head sadly, as she looked
through her tears at the vague distance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, whativer is the matter, sister?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver. She was
not an imaginative woman, but it occurred to her that the large toilet-glass in
sister Pullet&rsquo;s best bedroom was possibly broken for the second time.
</p>

<p>
There was no reply but a further shake of the head, as Mrs Pullet slowly rose
and got down from the chaise, not without casting a glance at Mr Pullet to see
that he was guarding her handsome silk dress from injury. Mr Pullet was a
small man, with a high nose, small twinkling eyes, and thin lips, in a
fresh-looking suit of black and a white cravat, that seemed to have been tied
very tight on some higher principle than that of mere personal ease. He bore
about the same relation to his tall, good-looking wife, with her balloon
sleeves, abundant mantle, and a large befeathered and beribboned bonnet, as a
small fishing-smack bears to a brig with all its sails spread.
</p>

<p>
It is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity introduced into
the emotions by a high state of civilisation, the sight of a fashionably
dressed female in grief. From the sorrow of a Hottentot to that of a woman in
large buckram sleeves, with several bracelets on each arm, an architectural
bonnet, and delicate ribbon strings, what a long series of gradations! In the
enlightened child of civilisation the abandonment characteristic of grief is
checked and varied in the subtlest manner, so as to present an interesting
problem to the analytic mind. If, with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded by
the mist of tears, she were to walk with a too devious step through a
door-place, she might crush her buckram sleeves too, and the deep consciousness
of this possibility produces a composition of forces by which she takes a line
that just clears the door-post. Perceiving that the tears are hurrying fast,
she unpins her strings and throws them languidly backward, a touching gesture,
indicative, even in the deepest gloom, of the hope in future dry moments when
cap-strings will once more have a charm. As the tears subside a little, and
with her head leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet,
she endures that terrible moment when grief, which has made all things else a
weariness, has itself become weary; she looks down pensively at her bracelets,
and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied fortuity which would be
gratifying to her mind if it were once more in a calm and healthy state.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet brushed each door-post with great nicety, about the latitude of her
shoulders (at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an instructed eye if
she did not measure a yard and a half across the shoulders), and having done
that sent the muscles of her face in quest of fresh tears as she advanced into
the parlour where Mrs Glegg was seated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sister, you&rsquo;re late; what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said
Mrs Glegg, rather sharply, as they shook hands.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet sat down, lifting up her mantle carefully behind, before she
answered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; unconsciously using an impressive figure of
rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the glass this time, then,&rdquo; thought Mrs Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Died the day before yesterday,&rdquo; continued Mrs Pullet;
&ldquo;an&rsquo; her legs was as thick as my body,&rdquo; she added, with deep
sadness, after a pause. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d tapped her no end o&rsquo; times,
and the water&mdash;they say you might ha&rsquo; swum in it, if you&rsquo;d
liked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Sophy, it&rsquo;s a mercy she&rsquo;s gone, then, whoever she may
be,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, with the promptitude and emphasis of a mind
naturally clear and decided; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t think who you&rsquo;re
talking of, for my part.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But <i>I</i> know,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, sighing and shaking her
head; &ldquo;and there isn&rsquo;t another such a dropsy in the parish.
<i>I</i> know as it&rsquo;s old Mrs Sutton o&rsquo; the Twentylands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s no kin o&rsquo; yours, nor much acquaintance as
I&rsquo;ve ever heared of,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, who always cried just as
much as was proper when anything happened to her own &ldquo;kin,&rdquo; but not
on other occasions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so much acquaintance as I&rsquo;ve seen her legs when they
was like bladders. And an old lady as had doubled her money over and over
again, and kept it all in her own management to the last, and had her pocket
with her keys in under her pillow constant. There isn&rsquo;t many old
<i>par</i>ish&rsquo;ners like her, I doubt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And they say she&rsquo;d took as much physic as &rsquo;ud fill a
wagon,&rdquo; observed Mr Pullet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Mrs Pullet, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d another complaint ever
so many years before she had the dropsy, and the doctors couldn&rsquo;t make
out what it was. And she said to me, when I went to see her last Christmas, she
said, &lsquo;Mrs Pullet, if ever you have the dropsy, you&rsquo;ll think
o&rsquo; me.&rsquo; She <i>did</i> say so,&rdquo; added Mrs Pullet, beginning
to cry bitterly again; &ldquo;those were her very words. And she&rsquo;s to be
buried o&rsquo; Saturday, and Pullet&rsquo;s bid to the funeral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sophy,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, unable any longer to contain her spirit
of rational remonstrance,&mdash;&ldquo;Sophy, I wonder <i>at</i> you, fretting
and injuring your health about people as don&rsquo;t belong to you. Your poor
father never did so, nor your aunt Frances neither, nor any o&rsquo; the family
as I ever heard of. You couldn&rsquo;t fret no more than this, if we&rsquo;d
heared as our cousin Abbott had died sudden without making his will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet was silent, having to finish her crying, and rather flattered than
indignant at being upbraided for crying too much. It was not everybody who
could afford to cry so much about their neighbours who had left them nothing;
but Mrs Pullet had married a gentleman farmer, and had leisure and money to
carry her crying and everything else to the highest pitch of respectability.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs Sutton didn&rsquo;t die without making her will, though,&rdquo;
said Mr Pullet, with a confused sense that he was saying something to sanction
his wife&rsquo;s tears; &ldquo;ours is a rich parish, but they say
there&rsquo;s nobody else to leave as many thousands behind &rsquo;em as Mrs
Sutton. And she&rsquo;s left no leggicies to speak on,&mdash;left it all in a
lump to her husband&rsquo;s nevvy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t much good i&rsquo; being so rich, then,&rdquo; said
Mrs Glegg, &ldquo;if she&rsquo;d got none but husband&rsquo;s kin to leave it
to. It&rsquo;s poor work when that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to pinch
yourself for. Not as I&rsquo;m one o&rsquo; those as &rsquo;ud like to die
without leaving more money out at interest than other folks had reckoned; but
it&rsquo;s a poor tale when it must go out o&rsquo; your own family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, sister,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, who had recovered
sufficiently to take off her veil and fold it carefully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
nice sort o&rsquo; man as Mrs Sutton has left her money to, for he&rsquo;s
troubled with the asthmy, and goes to bed every night at eight o&rsquo;clock.
He told me about it himself&mdash;as free as could be&mdash;one Sunday when he
came to our church. He wears a hareskin on his chest, and has a trembling in
his talk,&mdash;quite a gentleman sort o&rsquo; man. I told him there
wasn&rsquo;t many months in the year as I wasn&rsquo;t under the doctor&rsquo;s
hands. And he said, &lsquo;Mrs Pullet, I can feel for you.&rsquo; That was
what he said,&mdash;the very words. Ah!&rdquo; sighed Mrs Pullet, shaking her
head at the idea that there were but few who could enter fully into her
experiences in pink mixture and white mixture, strong stuff in small bottles,
and weak stuff in large bottles, damp boluses at a shilling, and draughts at
eighteenpence. &ldquo;Sister, I may as well go and take my bonnet off now. Did
you see as the cap-box was put out?&rdquo; she added, turning to her husband.
</p>

<p>
Mr Pullet, by an unaccountable lapse of memory, had forgotten it, and hastened
out, with a stricken conscience, to remedy the omission.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll bring it upstairs, sister,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver,
wishing to go at once, lest Mrs Glegg should begin to explain her feelings
about Sophy&rsquo;s being the first Dodson who ever ruined her constitution
with doctor&rsquo;s stuff.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her sister Pullet, and looking
thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head, and discussing millinery
in general. This was part of Bessy&rsquo;s weakness that stirred Mrs
Glegg&rsquo;s sisterly compassion: Bessy went far too well dressed,
considering; and she was too proud to dress her child in the good clothing her
sister Glegg gave her from the primeval strata of her wardrobe; it was a sin
and a shame to buy anything to dress that child, if it wasn&rsquo;t a pair of
shoes. In this particular, however, Mrs Glegg did her sister Bessy some
injustice, for Mrs Tulliver had really made great efforts to induce Maggie to
wear a leghorn bonnet and a dyed silk frock made out of her aunt Glegg&rsquo;s,
but the results had been such that Mrs Tulliver was obliged to bury them in her
maternal bosom; for Maggie, declaring that the frock smelt of nasty dye, had
taken an opportunity of basting it together with the roast beef the first
Sunday she wore it, and finding this scheme answer, she had subsequently pumped
on the bonnet with its green ribbons, so as to give it a general resemblance to
a sage cheese garnished with withered lettuces. I must urge in excuse for
Maggie, that Tom had laughed at her in the bonnet, and said she looked like an
old Judy. Aunt Pullet, too, made presents of clothes, but these were always
pretty enough to please Maggie as well as her mother. Of all her sisters, Mrs
Tulliver certainly preferred her sister Pullet, not without a return of
preference; but Mrs Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty, awkward children;
she would do the best she could by them, but it was a pity they weren&rsquo;t
as good and as pretty as sister Deane&rsquo;s child. Maggie and Tom, on their
part, thought their aunt Pullet tolerable, chiefly because she was not their
aunt Glegg. Tom always declined to go more than once during his holidays to see
either of them. Both his uncles tipped him that once, of course; but at his
aunt Pullet&rsquo;s there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellar-area,
so that he preferred the visit to her. Maggie shuddered at the toads, and
dreamed of them horribly, but she liked her uncle Pullet&rsquo;s musical
snuff-box. Still, it was agreed by the sisters, in Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s
absence, that the Tulliver blood did not mix well with the Dodson blood; that,
in fact, poor Bessy&rsquo;s children were Tullivers, and that Tom,
notwithstanding he had the Dodson complexion, was likely to be as
&ldquo;contrairy&rdquo; as his father. As for Maggie, she was the picture of
her aunt Moss, Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s sister,&mdash;a large-boned woman, who had
married as poorly as could be; had no china, and had a husband who had much ado
to pay his rent. But when Mrs Pullet was alone with Mrs Tulliver upstairs, the
remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of Mrs Glegg, and they agreed, in
confidence, that there was no knowing what sort of fright sister Jane would
come out next. But their <i>tête-à-tête</i> was curtailed by the appearance of
Mrs Deane with little Lucy; and Mrs Tulliver had to look on with a silent pang
while Lucy&rsquo;s blond curls were adjusted. It was quite unaccountable that
Mrs Deane, the thinnest and sallowest of all the Miss Dodsons, should have had
this child, who might have been taken for Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s any day. And
Maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the side of Lucy.
</p>

<p>
She did to-day, when she and Tom came in from the garden with their father and
their uncle Glegg. Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly, and coming
in with her hair rough as well as out of curl, rushed at once to Lucy, who was
standing by her mother&rsquo;s knee. Certainly the contrast between the cousins
was conspicuous, and to superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of
Maggie though a connoisseur might have seen &ldquo;points&rdquo; in her which
had a higher promise for maturity than Lucy&rsquo;s natty completeness. It was
like the contrast between a rough, dark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten.
Lucy put up the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed; everything about her
was neat,&mdash;her little round neck, with the row of coral beads; her little
straight nose, not at all snubby; her little clear eyebrows, rather darker than
her curls, to match hazel eyes, which looked up with shy pleasure at Maggie,
taller by the head, though scarcely a year older. Maggie always looked at Lucy
with delight.
</p>

<p>
She was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger than
children of their own age, and she made the queen of it just like Lucy, with a
little crown on her head, and a little sceptre in her hand&mdash;only the queen
was Maggie herself in Lucy&rsquo;s form.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lucy,&rdquo; she burst out, after kissing her, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
stay with Tom and me, won&rsquo;t you? Oh, kiss her, Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom, too, had come up to Lucy, but he was not going to kiss her&mdash;no; he
came up to her with Maggie, because it seemed easier, on the whole, than
saying, &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; to all those aunts and uncles. He stood
looking at nothing in particular, with the blushing, awkward air and semi-smile
which are common to shy boys when in company,&mdash;very much as if they had
come into the world by mistake, and found it in a degree of undress that was
quite embarrassing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heyday!&rdquo; said aunt Glegg, with loud emphasis. &ldquo;Do little
boys and gells come into a room without taking notice of their uncles and
aunts? That wasn&rsquo;t the way when <i>I</i> was a little gell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go and speak to your aunts and uncles, my dears,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, looking anxious and melancholy. She wanted to whisper to Maggie a
command to go and have her hair brushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, and how do you do? And I hope you&rsquo;re good children, are
you?&rdquo; said Aunt Glegg, in the same loud, emphatic way, as she took their
hands, hurting them with her large rings, and kissing their cheeks much against
their desire. &ldquo;Look up, Tom, look up. Boys as go to boarding-schools
should hold their heads up. Look at me now.&rdquo; Tom declined that pleasure
apparently, for he tried to draw his hand away. &ldquo;Put your hair behind
your ears, Maggie, and keep your frock on your shoulder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Aunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud, emphatic way, as if she
considered them deaf, or perhaps rather idiotic; it was a means, she thought,
of making them feel that they were accountable creatures, and might be a
salutary check on naughty tendencies. Bessy&rsquo;s children were so
spoiled&mdash;they&rsquo;d need have somebody to make them feel their duty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my dears,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, in a compassionate voice,
&ldquo;you grow wonderful fast. I doubt they&rsquo;ll outgrow their
strength,&rdquo; she added, looking over their heads, with a melancholy
expression, at their mother. &ldquo;I think the gell has too much hair.
I&rsquo;d have it thinned and cut shorter, sister, if I was you; it isn&rsquo;t
good for her health. It&rsquo;s that as makes her skin so brown, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Don&rsquo;t you think so, sister Deane?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, I&rsquo;m sure, sister,&rdquo; said Mrs Deane,
shutting her lips close again, and looking at Maggie with a critical eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;the child&rsquo;s healthy
enough; there&rsquo;s nothing ails her. There&rsquo;s red wheat as well as
white, for that matter, and some like the dark grain best. But it &rsquo;ud be
as well if Bessy &rsquo;ud have the child&rsquo;s hair cut, so as it &rsquo;ud
lie smooth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie&rsquo;s breast, but it was arrested
by the desire to know from her aunt Deane whether she would leave Lucy behind.
Aunt Deane would hardly ever let Lucy come to see them. After various reasons
for refusal, Mrs Deane appealed to Lucy herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like to stay behind without mother, should you,
Lucy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, please, mother,&rdquo; said Lucy, timidly, blushing very pink all
over her little neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well done, Lucy! Let her stay, Mrs Deane, let her stay,&rdquo; said Mr
Deane, a large but alert-looking man, with a type of <i>physique</i> to be seen
in all ranks of English society,&mdash;bald crown, red whiskers, full forehead,
and general solidity without heaviness. You may see noblemen like Mr Deane,
and you may see grocers or day-labourers like him; but the keenness of his
brown eyes was less common than his contour.
</p>

<p>
He held a silver snuff-box very tightly in his hand, and now and then exchanged
a pinch with Mr Tulliver, whose box was only silver-mounted, so that it was
naturally a joke between them that Mr Tulliver wanted to exchange snuff-boxes
also. Mr Deane&rsquo;s box had been given him by the superior partners in the
firm to which he belonged, at the same time that they gave him a share in the
business, in acknowledgment of his valuable services as manager. No man was
thought more highly of in St Ogg&rsquo;s than Mr Deane; and some persons were
even of opinion that Miss Susan Dodson, who was once held to have made the
worst match of all the Dodson sisters, might one day ride in a better carriage,
and live in a better house, even than her sister Pullet. There was no knowing
where a man would stop, who had got his foot into a great mill-owning,
ship-owning business like that of Guest &amp; Co., with a banking concern
attached. And Mrs Deane, as her intimate female friends observed, was proud
and &ldquo;having&rdquo; enough; <i>she</i> wouldn&rsquo;t let her husband
stand still in the world for want of spurring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, beckoning Maggie to her, and
whispering in her ear, as soon as this point of Lucy&rsquo;s staying was
settled, &ldquo;go and get your hair brushed, do, for shame. I told you not to
come in without going to Martha first, you know I did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom come out with me,&rdquo; whispered Maggie, pulling his sleeve as she
passed him; and Tom followed willingly enough.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come upstairs with me, Tom,&rdquo; she whispered, when they were outside
the door. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I want to do before dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to play at anything before dinner,&rdquo; said
Tom, whose imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, there is time for this; <i>do</i> come, Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom followed Maggie upstairs into her mother&rsquo;s room, and saw her go at
once to a drawer, from which she took out a large pair of scissors.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are they for, Maggie?&rdquo; said Tom, feeling his curiosity
awakened.
</p>

<p>
Maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight across the
middle of her forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my buttons! Maggie, you&rsquo;ll catch it!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d better not cut any more off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Snip! went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking, and he
couldn&rsquo;t help feeling it was rather good fun; Maggie would look so queer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, Tom, cut it behind for me,&rdquo; said Maggie, excited by her own
daring, and anxious to finish the deed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch it, you know,&rdquo; said Tom, nodding his head in an
admonitory manner, and hesitating a little as he took the scissors.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, make haste!&rdquo; said Maggie, giving a little stamp with
her foot. Her cheeks were quite flushed.
</p>

<p>
The black locks were so thick, nothing could be more tempting to a lad who had
already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony&rsquo;s mane. I speak
to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of scissors meet through a
duly resisting mass of hair. One delicious grinding snip, and then another and
another, and the hinder-locks fell heavily on the floor, and Maggie stood
cropped in a jagged, uneven manner, but with a sense of clearness and freedom,
as if she had emerged from a wood into the open plain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom, jumping round her, and slapping his knees
as he laughed, &ldquo;Oh, my buttons! what a queer thing you look! Look at
yourself in the glass; you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at
school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie felt an unexpected pang. She had thought beforehand chiefly at her own
deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it, and something
also of the triumph she should have over her mother and her aunts by this very
decided course of action; she didn&rsquo;t want her hair to look
pretty,&mdash;that was out of the question,&mdash;she only wanted people to
think her a clever little girl, and not to find fault with her. But now, when
Tom began to laugh at her, and say she was like an idiot, the affair had quite
a new aspect. She looked in the glass, and still Tom laughed and clapped his
hands, and Maggie&rsquo;s cheeks began to pale, and her lips to tremble a
little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Maggie, you&rsquo;ll have to go down to dinner directly,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, in a passionate tone,
with an outburst of angry tears, stamping, and giving him a push.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then, spitfire!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;What did you cut it off
for, then? I shall go down: I can smell the dinner going in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hurried downstairs and left poor Maggie to that bitter sense of the
irrevocable which was almost an everyday experience of her small soul. She
could see clearly enough, now the thing was done, that it was very foolish, and
that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever; for
Maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse, and then saw not only their
consequences, but what would have happened if they had not been done, with all
the detail and exaggerated circumstance of an active imagination. Tom never did
the same sort of foolish things as Maggie, having a wonderful instinctive
discernment of what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage; and so it
happened, that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie, his
mother hardly ever called him naughty. But if Tom did make a mistake of that
sort, he espoused it, and stood by it: he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; If
he broke the lash of his father&rsquo;s gigwhip by lashing the gate, he
couldn&rsquo;t help it,&mdash;the whip shouldn&rsquo;t have got caught in the
hinge. If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate, he was convinced, not that the whipping
of gates by all boys was a justifiable act, but that he, Tom Tulliver, was
justifiable in whipping that particular gate, and he wasn&rsquo;t going to be
sorry. But Maggie, as she stood crying before the glass, felt it impossible
that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words
of her aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and Martha, who waited at table, and perhaps
her father and her uncles, would laugh at her; for if Tom had laughed at her,
of course every one else would; and if she had only let her hair alone, she
could have sat with Tom and Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard!
What could she do but sob? She sat as helpless and despairing among her black
locks as Ajax among the slaughtered sheep. Very trivial, perhaps, this anguish
seems to weather-worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills, dead loves,
and broken friendships; but it was not less bitter to Maggie&mdash;perhaps it
was even more bitter&mdash;than what we are fond of calling antithetically the
real troubles of mature life. &ldquo;Ah, my child, you will have real troubles
to fret about by and by,&rdquo; is the consolation we have almost all of us had
administered to us in our childhood, and have repeated to other children since
we have been grown up. We have all of us sobbed so piteously, standing with
tiny bare legs above our little socks, when we lost sight of our mother or
nurse in some strange place; but we can no longer recall the poignancy of that
moment and weep over it, as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten
years ago. Every one of those keen moments has left its trace, and lives in us
still, but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the firmer
texture of our youth and manhood; and so it comes that we can look on at the
troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the reality of their pain.
Is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood, not merely
with a memory <i>of</i> what he did and what happened to him, of what he liked
and disliked when he was in frock and trousers, but with an intimate
penetration, a revived consciousness of what he felt then, when it was so long
from one Midsummer to another; what he felt when his school fellows shut him
out of their game because he would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness;
or on a rainy day in the holidays, when he didn&rsquo;t know how to amuse
himself, and fell from idleness into mischief, from mischief into defiance, and
from defiance into sulkiness; or when his mother absolutely refused to let him
have a tailed coat that &ldquo;half,&rdquo; although every other boy of his age
had gone into tails already? Surely if we could recall that early bitterness,
and the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless conception of life, that
gave the bitterness its intensity, we should not pooh-pooh the griefs of our
children.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Maggie, you&rsquo;re to come down this minute,&rdquo; said Kezia,
entering the room hurriedly. &ldquo;Lawks! what have you been a-doing? I never
<i>see</i> such a fright!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Kezia,&rdquo; said Maggie, angrily. &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I tell you you&rsquo;re to come down, Miss, this minute; your mother
says so,&rdquo; said Kezia, going up to Maggie and taking her by the hand to
raise her from the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get away, Kezia; I don&rsquo;t want any dinner,&rdquo; said Maggie,
resisting Kezia&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, I can&rsquo;t stay. I&rsquo;ve got to wait at dinner,&rdquo;
said Kezia, going out again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie, you little silly,&rdquo; said Tom, peeping into the room ten
minutes after, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you come and have your dinner?
There&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo; goodies, and mother says you&rsquo;re to come. What
are you crying for, you little spooney?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh, it was dreadful! Tom was so hard and unconcerned; if <i>he</i> had been
crying on the floor, Maggie would have cried too. And there was the dinner, so
nice; and she was <i>so</i> hungry. It was very bitter.
</p>

<p>
But Tom was not altogether hard. He was not inclined to cry, and did not feel
that Maggie&rsquo;s grief spoiled his prospect of the sweets; but he went and
put his head near her, and said in a lower, comforting tone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come, then, Magsie? Shall I bring you a bit o&rsquo;
pudding when I&rsquo;ve had mine, and a custard and things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye-e-es,&rdquo; said Maggie, beginning to feel life a little more
tolerable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Tom, going away. But he turned again at the door
and said, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d better come, you know. There&rsquo;s the
dessert,&mdash;nuts, you know, and cowslip wine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s tears had ceased, and she looked reflective as Tom left her. His
good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering, and nuts with
cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence.
</p>

<p>
Slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks, and slowly she made her way
downstairs. Then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the frame of the
dining-parlour door, peeping in when it was ajar. She saw Tom and Lucy with an
empty chair between them, and there were the custards on a side-table; it was
too much. She slipped in and went toward the empty chair. But she had no sooner
sat down than she repented and wished herself back again.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her, and felt such a
&ldquo;turn&rdquo; that she dropped the large gravy-spoon into the dish, with
the most serious results to the table-cloth. For Kezia had not betrayed the
reason of Maggie&rsquo;s refusal to come down, not liking to give her mistress
a shock in the moment of carving, and Mrs Tulliver thought there was nothing
worse in question than a fit of perverseness, which was inflicting its own
punishment by depriving Maggie of half her dinner.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her
own, and Maggie&rsquo;s cheeks and ears began to burn, while uncle Glegg, a
kind-looking, white-haired old gentleman, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heyday! what little gell&rsquo;s this? Why, I don&rsquo;t know her. Is
it some little gell you&rsquo;ve picked up in the road, Kezia?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s gone and cut her hair herself,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver
in an undertone to Mr Deane, laughing with much enjoyment. Did you ever know
such a little hussy as it is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, little miss, you&rsquo;ve made yourself look very funny,&rdquo;
said Uncle Pullet, and perhaps he never in his life made an observation which
was felt to be so lacerating.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fie, for shame!&rdquo; said aunt Glegg, in her loudest, severest tone of
reproof. &ldquo;Little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed on
bread and water,&mdash;not come and sit down with their aunts and
uncles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said uncle Glegg, meaning to give a playful turn to this
denunciation, &ldquo;she must be sent to jail, I think, and they&rsquo;ll cut
the rest of her hair off there, and make it all even.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s more like a gypsy nor ever,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, in a
pitying tone; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very bad luck, sister, as the gell should be so
brown; the boy&rsquo;s fair enough. I doubt it&rsquo;ll stand in her way
i&rsquo; life to be so brown.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a naughty child, as&rsquo;ll break her mother&rsquo;s
heart,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, with the tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Maggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision. Her first
flush came from anger, which gave her a transient power of defiance, and Tom
thought she was braving it out, supported by the recent appearance of the
pudding and custard. Under this impression, he whispered, &ldquo;Oh, my!
Maggie, I told you you&rsquo;d catch it.&rdquo; He meant to be friendly, but
Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her ignominy. Her feeble power
of defiance left her in an instant, her heart swelled, and getting up from her
chair, she ran to her father, hid her face on his shoulder, and burst out into
loud sobbing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, my wench,&rdquo; said her father, soothingly, putting his
arm round her, &ldquo;never mind; you was i&rsquo; the right to cut it off if
it plagued you; give over crying; father&rsquo;ll take your part.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Delicious words of tenderness! Maggie never forgot any of these moments when
her father &ldquo;took her part&rdquo;; she kept them in her heart, and thought
of them long years after, when every one else said that her father had done
very ill by his children.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How your husband does spoil that child, Bessy!&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg,
in a loud &ldquo;aside,&rdquo; to Mrs Tulliver. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the ruin
of her, if you don&rsquo;t take care. <i>My</i> father never brought his
children up so, else we should ha&rsquo; been a different sort o&rsquo; family
to what we are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached
the point at which insensibility begins. She took no notice of her
sister&rsquo;s remark, but threw back her capstrings and dispensed the pudding,
in mute resignation.
</p>

<p>
With the dessert there came entire deliverance for Maggie, for the children
were told they might have their nuts and wine in the summer-house, since the
day was so mild; and they scampered out among the budding bushes of the garden
with the alacrity of small animals getting from under a burning glass.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver had her special reason for this permission: now the dinner was
despatched, and every one&rsquo;s mind disengaged, it was the right moment to
communicate Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s intention concerning Tom, and it would be as
well for Tom himself to be absent. The children were used to hear themselves
talked of as freely as if they were birds, and could understand nothing,
however they might stretch their necks and listen; but on this occasion Mrs
Tulliver manifested an unusual discretion, because she had recently had
evidence that the going to school to a clergyman was a sore point with Tom, who
looked at it as very much on a par with going to school to a constable. Mrs
Tulliver had a sighing sense that her husband would do as he liked, whatever
sister Glegg said, or sister Pullet either; but at least they would not be able
to say, if the thing turned out ill, that Bessy had fallen in with her
husband&rsquo;s folly without letting her own friends know a word about it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Tulliver,&rdquo; she said, interrupting her husband in his talk with
Mr Deane, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time now to tell the children&rsquo;s aunts and
uncles what you&rsquo;re thinking of doing with Tom, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, rather sharply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
no objections to tell anybody what I mean to do with him. I&rsquo;ve
settled,&rdquo; he added, looking toward Mr Glegg and Mr
Deane,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve settled to send him to a Mr Stelling, a parson,
down at King&rsquo;s Lorton, there,&mdash;an uncommon clever fellow, I
understand, as&rsquo;ll put him up to most things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company, such as you may
have observed in a country congregation when they hear an allusion to their
week-day affairs from the pulpit. It was equally astonishing to the aunts and
uncles to find a parson introduced into Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s family
arrangements. As for uncle Pullet, he could hardly have been more thoroughly
obfuscated if Mr Tulliver had said that he was going to send Tom to the Lord
Chancellor; for uncle Pullet belonged to that extinct class of British yeoman
who, dressed in good broadcloth, paid high rates and taxes, went to church, and
ate a particularly good dinner on Sunday, without dreaming that the British
constitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than the solar
system and the fixed stars.
</p>

<p>
It is melancholy, but true, that Mr Pullet had the most confused idea of a
bishop as a sort of a baronet, who might or might not be a clergyman; and as
the rector of his own parish was a man of high family and fortune, the idea
that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too remote from Mr Pullet&rsquo;s
experience to be readily conceivable. I know it is difficult for people in
these instructed times to believe in uncle Pullet&rsquo;s ignorance; but let
them reflect on the remarkable results of a great natural faculty under
favouring circumstances. And uncle Pullet had a great natural faculty for
ignorance. He was the first to give utterance to his astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what can you be going to send him to a parson for?&rdquo; he said,
with an amazed twinkling in his eyes, looking at Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, to
see if they showed any signs of comprehension.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, because the parsons are the best schoolmasters, by what I can make
out,&rdquo; said poor Mr Tulliver, who, in the maze of this puzzling world,
laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity. &ldquo;Jacobs at
th&rsquo; academy&rsquo;s no parson, and he&rsquo;s done very bad by the boy;
and I made up my mind, if I send him to school again, it should be to somebody
different to Jacobs. And this Mr Stelling, by what I can make out, is the sort
o&rsquo; man I want. And I mean my boy to go to him at Midsummer,&rdquo; he
concluded, in a tone of decision, tapping his snuff-box and taking a pinch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pay a swinging half-yearly bill, then, eh,
Tulliver? The clergymen have highish notions, in general,&rdquo; said Mr
Deane, taking snuff vigorously, as he always did when wishing to maintain a
neutral position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! do you think the parson&rsquo;ll teach him to know a good sample
o&rsquo; wheat when he sees it, neighbour Tulliver?&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, who
was fond of his jest, and having retired from business, felt that it was not
only allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you see, I&rsquo;ve got a plan i&rsquo; my head about Tom,&rdquo;
said Mr Tulliver, pausing after that statement and lifting up his glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if I may be allowed to speak, and it&rsquo;s seldom as I
am,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, with a tone of bitter meaning, &ldquo;I should like
to know what good is to come to the boy by bringin&rsquo; him up above his
fortin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, not looking at Mrs Glegg, but at the
male part of his audience, &ldquo;you see, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind not to
bring Tom up to my own business. I&rsquo;ve had my thoughts about it all along,
and I made up my mind by what I saw with Garnett and <i>his</i> son. I mean to
put him to some business as he can go into without capital, and I want to give
him an eddication as he&rsquo;ll be even wi&rsquo; the lawyers and folks, and
put me up to a notion now an&rsquo; then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips, that smiled
in mingled pity and scorn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It &rsquo;ud be a fine deal better for some people,&rdquo; she said,
after that introductory note, &ldquo;if they&rsquo;d let the lawyers
alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he at the head of a grammar school, then, this clergyman, such as
that at Market Bewley?&rdquo; said Mr Deane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, nothing of that,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
take more than two or three pupils, and so he&rsquo;ll have the more time to
attend to &rsquo;em, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, and get his eddication done the sooner; they can&rsquo;t learn much
at a time when there&rsquo;s so many of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said uncle Pullet,
feeling that he was getting quite an insight into this difficult matter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll want the more pay, I doubt,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, a cool hundred a year, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver, with some pride at his own spirited course. &ldquo;But then, you
know, it&rsquo;s an investment; Tom&rsquo;s eddication &rsquo;ull be so much
capital to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, there&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg. &ldquo;Well
well, neighbour Tulliver, you may be right, you may be right:
</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;When land is gone and money&rsquo;s spent,<br/>
Then learning is most excellent.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton. But us
that have got no learning had better keep our money, eh, neighbour
Pullet?&rdquo; Mr Glegg rubbed his knees, and looked very pleasant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg, I wonder <i>at</i> you,&rdquo; said his wife.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unbecoming in a man o&rsquo; your age and
belongings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s unbecoming, Mrs G.?&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, winking
pleasantly at the company. &ldquo;My new blue coat as I&rsquo;ve got on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I pity your weakness, Mr Glegg. I say it&rsquo;s unbecoming to be
making a joke when you see your own kin going headlongs to ruin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you mean me by that,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, considerably nettled,
&ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself to fret about me. I can manage my own
affairs without troubling other folks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; said Mr Deane, judiciously introducing a new idea,
&ldquo;why, now I come to think of it, somebody said Wakem was going to send
<i>his</i> son&mdash;the deformed lad&mdash;to a clergyman, didn&rsquo;t they,
Susan?&rdquo; (appealing to his wife).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can give no account of it, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs Deane,
closing her lips very tightly again. Mrs Deane was not a woman to take part in
a scene where missiles were flying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, speaking all the more cheerfully, that
Mrs Glegg might see he didn&rsquo;t mind her, &ldquo;if Wakem thinks o&rsquo;
sending his son to a clergyman, depend on it I shall make no mistake i&rsquo;
sending Tom to one. Wakem&rsquo;s as big a scoundrel as Old Harry ever made,
but he knows the length of every man&rsquo;s foot he&rsquo;s got to deal with.
Ay, ay, tell me who&rsquo;s Wakem&rsquo;s butcher, and I&rsquo;ll tell you
where to get your meat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But lawyer Wakem&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s got a hump-back,&rdquo; said Mrs
Pullet, who felt as if the whole business had a funereal aspect;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s more nat&rsquo;ral to send <i>him</i> to a clergyman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, interpreting Mrs Pullet&rsquo;s observation
with erroneous plausibility, &ldquo;you must consider that, neighbour Tulliver;
Wakem&rsquo;s son isn&rsquo;t likely to follow any business. Wakem &rsquo;ull
make a gentleman of him, poor fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said Mrs G., in a tone which implied that her
indignation would fizz and ooze a little, though she was determined to keep it
corked up, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d far better hold your tongue. Mr Tulliver
doesn&rsquo;t want to know your opinion nor mine either. There&rsquo;s folks in
the world as know better than everybody else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I should think that&rsquo;s you, if we&rsquo;re to trust your own
tale,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, beginning to boil up again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> say nothing,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, sarcastically.
&ldquo;My advice has never been asked, and I don&rsquo;t give it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the first time, then,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing you&rsquo;re over-ready at giving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over-ready at lending, then, if I haven&rsquo;t been
over-ready at giving,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s folks
I&rsquo;ve lent money to, as perhaps I shall repent o&rsquo; lending money to
kin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, come,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, soothingly. But Mr Tulliver
was not to be hindered of his retort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a bond for it, I reckon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;ve had your five per cent, kin or no kin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, pleadingly, &ldquo;drink your wine,
and let me give you some almonds and raisins.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bessy, I&rsquo;m sorry for you,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, very much with
the feeling of a cur that seizes the opportunity of diverting his bark toward
the man who carries no stick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s poor work talking o&rsquo;
almonds and raisins.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lors, sister Glegg, don&rsquo;t be so quarrelsome,&rdquo; said Mrs
Pullet, beginning to cry a little. &ldquo;You may be struck with a fit, getting
so red in the face after dinner, and we are but just out o&rsquo; mourning, all
of us,&mdash;and all wi&rsquo; gowns craped alike and just put by; it&rsquo;s
very bad among sisters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think it <i>is</i> bad,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg. &ldquo;Things
are come to a fine pass when one sister invites the other to her house o&rsquo;
purpose to quarrel with her and abuse her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Softly, softly, Jane; be reasonable, be reasonable,&rdquo; said Mr
Glegg.
</p>

<p>
But while he was speaking, Mr Tulliver, who had by no means said enough to
satisfy his anger, burst out again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who wants to quarrel with you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you as
can&rsquo;t let people alone, but must be gnawing at &rsquo;em forever.
<i>I</i> should never want to quarrel with any woman if she kept her
place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My place, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, getting rather more shrill.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your betters, Mr Tulliver, as are dead and in their
grave, treated me with a different sort o&rsquo; respect to what you do;
<i>though</i> I&rsquo;ve got a husband as&rsquo;ll sit by and see me abused by
them as &rsquo;ud never ha&rsquo; had the chance if there hadn&rsquo;t been
them in our family as married worse than they might ha&rsquo; done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you talk o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;my
family&rsquo;s as good as yours, and better, for it hasn&rsquo;t got a damned
ill-tempered woman in it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, rising from her chair, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether you think it&rsquo;s a fine thing to sit by and hear
me swore at, Mr Glegg; but I&rsquo;m not going to stay a minute longer in this
house. You can stay behind, and come home with the gig, and I&rsquo;ll walk
home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear heart, dear heart!&rdquo; said Mr Glegg in a melancholy tone, as
he followed his wife out of the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Tulliver, how could you talk so?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, with the
tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, too hot to be damped by any amount
of tears. &ldquo;Let her go, and the sooner the better; she won&rsquo;t be
trying to domineer over <i>me</i> again in a hurry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister Pullet,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, helplessly, &ldquo;do you
think it &rsquo;ud be any use for you to go after her and try to pacify
her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better not, better not,&rdquo; said Mr Deane. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make
it up another day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, sisters, shall we go and look at the children?&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, drying her eyes.
</p>

<p>
No proposition could have been more seasonable. Mr Tulliver felt very much as
if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women were out of the
room. There were few things he liked better than a chat with Mr Deane, whose
close application to business allowed the pleasure very rarely. Mr Deane, he
considered, was the &ldquo;knowingest&rdquo; man of his acquaintance, and he
had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made an agreeable supplement to
Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s own tendency that way, which had remained in rather an
inarticulate condition. And now the women were gone, they could carry on their
serious talk without frivolous interruption. They could exchange their views
concerning the Duke of Wellington, whose conduct in the Catholic Question had
thrown such an entirely new light on his character; and speak slightingly of
his conduct at the battle of Waterloo, which he would never have won if there
hadn&rsquo;t been a great many Englishmen at his back, not to speak of Blucher
and the Prussians, who, as Mr Tulliver had heard from a person of particular
knowledge in that matter, had come up in the very nick of time; though here
there was a slight dissidence, Mr Deane remarking that he was not disposed to
give much credit to the Prussians,&mdash;the build of their vessels, together
with the unsatisfactory character of transactions in Dantzic beer, inclining
him to form rather a low view of Prussian pluck generally. Rather beaten on
this ground, Mr Tulliver proceeded to express his fears that the country could
never again be what it used to be; but Mr Deane, attached to a firm of which
the returns were on the increase, naturally took a more lively view of the
present, and had some details to give concerning the state of the imports,
especially in hides and spelter, which soothed Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s imagination
by throwing into more distant perspective the period when the country would
become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals, and there would be no more
chance for honest men.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high matters. He
didn&rsquo;t understand politics himself,&mdash;thought they were a natural
gift,&mdash;but by what he could make out, this Duke of Wellington was no
better than he should be.

Mr Tulliver Shows His Weaker Side</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose sister Glegg should call her money in; it &rsquo;ud be very
awkward for you to have to raise five hundred pounds now,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver to her husband that evening, as she took a plaintive review of the
day.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband, yet she retained in
all the freshness of her early married life a facility of saying things which
drove him in the opposite direction to the one she desired. Some minds are
wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way, as a patriarchal goldfish
apparently retains to the last its youthful illusion that it can swim in a
straight line beyond the encircling glass. Mrs Tulliver was an amiable fish of
this kind, and after running her head against the same resisting medium for
thirteen years would go at it again to-day with undulled alacrity.
</p>

<p>
This observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr Tulliver that it would
not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds; and when Mrs
Tulliver became rather pressing to know <i>how</i> he would raise it without
mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he never <i>would</i>
mortgage, since nowadays people were none so ready to lend money without
security, Mr Tulliver, getting warm, declared that Mrs Glegg might do as she
liked about calling in her money, he should pay it in whether or not. He was
not going to be beholden to his wife&rsquo;s sisters. When a man had married
into a family where there was a whole litter of women, he might have plenty to
put up with if he chose. But Mr Tulliver did <i>not</i> choose.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver cried a little in a trickling, quiet way as she put on her
nightcap; but presently sank into a comfortable sleep, lulled by the thought
that she would talk everything over with her sister Pullet to-morrow, when she
was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea. Not that she looked forward to
any distinct issue from that talk; but it seemed impossible that past events
should be so obstinate as to remain unmodified when they were complained
against.
</p>

<p>
Her husband lay awake rather longer, for he too was thinking of a visit he
would pay on the morrow; and his ideas on the subject were not of so vague and
soothing a kind as those of his amiable partner.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver, when under the influence of a strong feeling, had a promptitude
in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful sense of the
complicated, puzzling nature of human affairs under which his more
dispassionate deliberations were conducted; but it is really not improbable
that there was a direct relation between these apparently contradictory
phenomena, since I have observed that for getting a strong impression that a
skein is tangled there is nothing like snatching hastily at a single thread. It
was owing to this promptitude that Mr Tulliver was on horseback soon after
dinner the next day (he was not dyspeptic) on his way to Basset to see his
sister Moss and her husband. For having made up his mind irrevocably that he
would pay Mrs Glegg her loan of five hundred pounds, it naturally occurred to
him that he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds lent to his
brother-in-law Moss; and if the said brother-in-law could manage to pay in the
money within a given time, it would go far to lessen the fallacious air of
inconvenience which Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s spirited step might have worn in the
eyes of weak people who require to know precisely <i>how</i> a thing is to be
done before they are strongly confident that it will be easy.
</p>

<p>
For Mr Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking, but, like other
everyday things, sure to have a cumulative effect that will be felt in the
long run: he was held to be a much more substantial man than he really was. And
as we are all apt to believe what the world believes about us, it was his habit
to think of failure and ruin with the same sort of remote pity with which a
spare, long-necked man hears that his plethoric short-necked neighbour is
stricken with apoplexy. He had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about
his advantages as a man who worked his own mill, and owned a pretty bit of
land; and these jokes naturally kept up his sense that he was a man of
considerable substance. They gave a pleasant flavour to his glass on a
market-day, and if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments,
Mr Tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two
thousand pounds on his very desirable freehold. That was not altogether his own
fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his sister&rsquo;s fortune, which
he had to pay on her marriage; and a man who has neighbours that <i>will</i> go
to law with him is not likely to pay off his mortgages, especially if he enjoys
the good opinion of acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on
security too lofty to be represented by parchment. Our friend Mr Tulliver had
a good-natured fibre in him, and did not like to give harsh refusals even to
his sister, who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way
characteristic of sisters, creating a necessity for mortgages, but had quite
thrown herself away in marriage, and had crowned her mistakes by having an
eighth baby. On this point Mr Tulliver was conscious of being a little weak;
but he apologised to himself by saying that poor Gritty had been a good-looking
wench before she married Moss; he would sometimes say this even with a slight
tremulousness in his voice. But this morning he was in a mood more becoming a
man of business, and in the course of his ride along the Basset lanes, with
their deep ruts,&mdash;lying so far away from a market-town that the labour of
drawing produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits
on such poor land as that parish was made of,&mdash;he got up a due amount of
irritation against Moss as a man without capital, who, if murrain and blight
were abroad, was sure to have his share of them, and who, the more you tried to
help him out of the mud, would sink the further in. It would do him good rather
than harm, now, if he were obliged to raise this three hundred pounds; it would
make him look about him better, and not act so foolishly about his wool this
year as he did the last; in fact, Mr Tulliver had been too easy with his
brother-in-law, and because he had let the interest run on for two years, Moss
was likely enough to think that he should never be troubled about the
principal. But Mr Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling
people any longer; and a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to enervate
a man&rsquo;s resolution by softening his temper. The deep-trodden hoof-marks,
made in the muddiest days of winter, gave him a shake now and then which
suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers, who, whether
by means of his hoof or otherwise, had doubtless something to do with this
state of the roads; and the abundance of foul land and neglected fences that
met his eye, though they made no part of his brother Moss&rsquo;s farm,
strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction with that unlucky agriculturist. If
this wasn&rsquo;t Moss&rsquo;s fallow, it might have been; Basset was all
alike; it was a beggarly parish, in Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s opinion, and his
opinion was certainly not groundless. Basset had a poor soil, poor roads, a
poor non-resident landlord, a poor non-resident vicar, and rather less than
half a curate, also poor. If any one strongly impressed with the power of the
human mind to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of
Basset might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people, I have
nothing to urge against that abstract proposition; I only know that, in point
of fact, the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its circumstances. The
muddy lanes, green or clayey, that seemed to the unaccustomed eye to lead
nowhere but into each other, did really lead, with patience, to a distant
high-road; but there were many feet in Basset which they led more frequently to
a centre of dissipation, spoken of formerly as the &ldquo;Markis o&rsquo;
Granby,&rdquo; but among intimates as &ldquo;Dickison&rsquo;s.&rdquo; A large
low room with a sanded floor; a cold scent of tobacco, modified by undetected
beer-dregs; Mr Dickison leaning against the door-post with a melancholy
pimpled face, looking as irrelevant to the daylight as a last night&rsquo;s
guttered candle,&mdash;all this may not seem a very seductive form of
temptation; but the majority of men in Basset found it fatally alluring when
encountered on their road toward four o&rsquo;clock on a wintry afternoon; and
if any wife in Basset wished to indicate that her husband was not a
pleasure-seeking man, she could hardly do it more emphatically than by saying
that he didn&rsquo;t spend a shilling at Dickison&rsquo;s from one Whitsuntide
to another. Mrs Moss had said so of <i>her</i> husband more than once, when
her brother was in a mood to find fault with him, as he certainly was to-day.
And nothing could be less pacifying to Mr Tulliver than the behaviour of the
farmyard gate, which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding-stick
than it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do, to the peril of
shins, whether equine or human. He was about to get down and lead his horse
through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard, shadowed drearily by the large
half-timbered buildings, up to the long line of tumble-down dwelling-houses
standing on a raised causeway; but the timely appearance of a cowboy saved him
that frustration of a plan he had determined on,&mdash;namely, not to get down
from his horse during this visit. If a man means to be hard, let him keep in
his saddle and speak from that height, above the level of pleading eyes, and
with the command of a distant horizon. Mrs Moss heard the sound of the
horse&rsquo;s feet, and, when her brother rode up, was already outside the
kitchen door, with a half-weary smile on her face, and a black-eyed baby in her
arms. Mrs Moss&rsquo;s face bore a faded resemblance to her brother&rsquo;s;
baby&rsquo;s little fat hand, pressed against her cheek, seemed to show more
strikingly that the cheek was faded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Brother, I&rsquo;m glad to see you,&rdquo; she said, in an affectionate
tone. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t look for you to-day. How do you do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, pretty well, Mrs Moss, pretty well,&rdquo; answered the brother,
with cool deliberation, as if it were rather too forward of her to ask that
question. She knew at once that her brother was not in a good humour; he never
called her Mrs Moss except when he was angry, and when they were in company.
But she thought it was in the order of nature that people who were poorly off
should be snubbed. Mrs Moss did not take her stand on the equality of the
human race; she was a patient, prolific, loving-hearted woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your husband isn&rsquo;t in the house, I suppose?&rdquo; added Mr
Tulliver after a grave pause, during which four children had run out, like
chickens whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hen-coop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s only in the
potato-field yonders. Georgy, run to the Far Close in a minute, and tell father
your uncle&rsquo;s come. You&rsquo;ll get down, brother, won&rsquo;t you, and
take something?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; I can&rsquo;t get down. I must be going home again
directly,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, looking at the distance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s Mrs Tulliver and the children?&rdquo; said Mrs Moss,
humbly, not daring to press her invitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, pretty well. Tom&rsquo;s going to a new school at Midsummer,&mdash;a
deal of expense to me. It&rsquo;s bad work for me, lying out o&rsquo; my
money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d be so good as let the children come and see their
cousins some day. My little uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as never
was. And me her godmother, and so fond of her; there&rsquo;s nobody &rsquo;ud
make a bigger fuss with her, according to what they&rsquo;ve got. And I know
she likes to come, for she&rsquo;s a loving child, and how quick and clever she
is, to be sure!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If Mrs Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world, instead of
being one of the simplest, she could have thought of nothing more likely to
propitiate her brother than this praise of Maggie. He seldom found any one
volunteering praise of &ldquo;the little wench&rdquo;; it was usually left
entirely to himself to insist on her merits. But Maggie always appeared in the
most amiable light at her aunt Moss&rsquo;s; it was her Alsatia, where she was
out of the reach of law,&mdash;if she upset anything, dirtied her shoes, or
tore her frock, these things were matters of course at her aunt Moss&rsquo;s.
In spite of himself, Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s eyes got milder, and he did not look
away from his sister as he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay; she&rsquo;s fonder o&rsquo; you than o&rsquo; the other aunts, I
think. She takes after our family: not a bit of her mother&rsquo;s in
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Moss says she&rsquo;s just like what I used to be,&rdquo; said Mrs
Moss, &ldquo;though I was never so quick and fond o&rsquo; the books. But I
think my Lizzy&rsquo;s like her; <i>she&rsquo;s</i> sharp. Come here, Lizzy, my
dear, and let your uncle see you; he hardly knows you, you grow so fast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lizzy, a black-eyed child of seven, looked very shy when her mother drew her
forward, for the small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle from Dorlcote
Mill. She was inferior enough to Maggie in fire and strength of expression to
make the resemblance between the two entirely flattering to Mr
Tulliver&rsquo;s fatherly love.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, they&rsquo;re a bit alike,&rdquo; he said, looking kindly at the
little figure in the soiled pinafore. &ldquo;They both take after our mother.
You&rsquo;ve got enough o&rsquo; gells, Gritty,&rdquo; he added, in a tone half
compassionate, half reproachful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Four of &rsquo;em, bless &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, with a sigh,
stroking Lizzy&rsquo;s hair on each side of her forehead; &ldquo;as many as
there&rsquo;s boys. They&rsquo;ve got a brother apiece.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but they must turn out and fend for themselves,&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver, feeling that his severity was relaxing and trying to brace it by
throwing out a wholesome hint &ldquo;They mustn&rsquo;t look to hanging on
their brothers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; but I hope their brothers &rsquo;ull love the poor things, and
remember they came o&rsquo; one father and mother; the lads &rsquo;ull never be
the poorer for that,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, flashing out with hurried timidity,
like a half-smothered fire.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank, then checked it, and
said angrily, &ldquo;Stand still with you!&rdquo; much to the astonishment of
that innocent animal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the more there is of &rsquo;em, the more they must love one
another,&rdquo; Mrs Moss went on, looking at her children with a didactic
purpose. But she turned toward her brother again to say, &ldquo;Not but what I
hope your boy &rsquo;ull allays be good to his sister, though there&rsquo;s but
two of &rsquo;em, like you and me, brother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The arrow went straight to Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s heart. He had not a rapid
imagination, but the thought of Maggie was very near to him, and he was not
long in seeing his relation to his own sister side by side with Tom&rsquo;s
relation to Maggie. Would the little wench ever be poorly off, and Tom rather
hard upon her?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Gritty,&rdquo; said the miller, with a new softness in his tone;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve allays done what I could for you,&rdquo; he added, as if
vindicating himself from a reproach.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denying that, brother, and I&rsquo;m noways
ungrateful,&rdquo; said poor Mrs Moss, too fagged by toil and children to have
strength left for any pride. &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the father. What a while
you&rsquo;ve been, Moss!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;While, do you call it?&rdquo; said Mr Moss, feeling out of breath and
injured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running all the way. Won&rsquo;t you
&rsquo;light, Mr Tulliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll just get down and have a bit o&rsquo; talk with you in
the garden,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, thinking that he should be more likely to
show a due spirit of resolve if his sister were not present.
</p>

<p>
He got down, and passed with Mr Moss into the garden, toward an old yew-tree
arbour, while his sister stood tapping her baby on the back and looking
wistfully after them.
</p>

<p>
Their entrance into the yew-tree arbour surprised several fowls that were
recreating themselves by scratching deep holes in the dusty ground, and at once
took flight with much pother and cackling. Mr Tulliver sat down on the bench,
and tapping the ground curiously here and there with his stick, as if he
suspected some hollowness, opened the conversation by observing, with something
like a snarl in his tone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve got wheat again in that Corner Close, I see; and never
a bit o&rsquo; dressing on it. You&rsquo;ll do no good with it this
year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Moss, who, when he married Miss Tulliver, had been regarded as the buck of
Basset, now wore a beard nearly a week old, and had the depressed, unexpectant
air of a machine-horse. He answered in a patient-grumbling tone, &ldquo;Why,
poor farmers like me must do as they can; they must leave it to them as have
got money to play with, to put half as much into the ground as they mean to get
out of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who should have money to play with, if it isn&rsquo;t
them as can borrow money without paying interest,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, who
wished to get into a slight quarrel; it was the most natural and easy
introduction to calling in money.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m behind with the interest,&rdquo; said Mr Moss,
&ldquo;but I was so unlucky wi&rsquo; the wool last year; and what with the
Missis being laid up so, things have gone awk&rsquo;arder nor usual.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; snarled Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s folks as things
&rsquo;ull allays go awk&rsquo;ard with; empty sacks &rsquo;ull never stand
upright.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what fault you&rsquo;ve got to find wi&rsquo;
me, Mr Tulliver,&rdquo; said Mr Moss, deprecatingly; &ldquo;I know there
isn&rsquo;t a day-labourer works harder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, sharply,
&ldquo;when a man marries, and&rsquo;s got no capital to work his farm but his
wife&rsquo;s bit o&rsquo; fortin? I was against it from the first; but
you&rsquo;d neither of you listen to me. And I can&rsquo;t lie out o&rsquo; my
money any longer, for I&rsquo;ve got to pay five hundred o&rsquo; Mrs
Glegg&rsquo;s, and there&rsquo;ll be Tom an expense to me. I should find myself
short, even saying I&rsquo;d got back all as is my own. You must look about and
see how you can pay me the three hundred pound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; said Mr Moss, looking
blankly before him, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better be sold up, and ha&rsquo; done
with it; I must part wi&rsquo; every head o&rsquo; stock I&rsquo;ve got, to pay
you and the landlord too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor relations are undeniably irritating,&mdash;their existence is so entirely
uncalled for on our part, and they are almost always very faulty people. Mr
Tulliver had succeeded in getting quite as much irritated with Mr Moss as he
had desired, and he was able to say angrily, rising from his seat,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you must do as you can. <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t find money for
everybody else as well as myself. I must look to my own business and my own
family. I can&rsquo;t lie out o&rsquo; my money any longer. You must raise it
as quick as you can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbour as he uttered the last sentence,
and, without looking round at Mr Moss, went on to the kitchen door, where the
eldest boy was holding his horse, and his sister was waiting in a state of
wondering alarm, which was not without its alleviations, for baby was making
pleasant gurgling sounds, and performing a great deal of finger practice on the
faded face. Mrs Moss had eight children, but could never overcome her regret
that the twins had not lived. Mr Moss thought their removal was not without
its consolations. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in, brother?&rdquo; she said,
looking anxiously at her husband, who was walking slowly up, while Mr Tulliver
had his foot already in the stirrup.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; good-by,&rdquo; said he, turning his horse&rsquo;s head, and
riding away.
</p>

<p>
No man could feel more resolute till he got outside the yard gate, and a little
way along the deep-rutted lane; but before he reached the next turning, which
would take him out of sight of the dilapidated farm-buildings, he appeared to
be smitten by some sudden thought. He checked his horse, and made it stand
still in the same spot for two or three minutes, during which he turned his
head from side to side in a melancholy way, as if he were looking at some
painful object on more sides than one. Evidently, after his fit of promptitude,
Mr Tulliver was relapsing into the sense that this is a puzzling world. He
turned his horse, and rode slowly back, giving vent to the climax of feeling
which had determined this movement by saying aloud, as he struck his horse,
&ldquo;Poor little wench! she&rsquo;ll have nobody but Tom, belike, when
I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s return into the yard was descried by several young Mosses,
who immediately ran in with the exciting news to their mother, so that Mrs
Moss was again on the door-step when her brother rode up. She had been crying,
but was rocking baby to sleep in her arms now, and made no ostentatious show of
sorrow as her brother looked at her, but merely said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The father&rsquo;s gone to the field, again, if you want him,
brother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Gritty, no,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, in a gentle tone.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make a
shift without the money a bit, only you must be as clever and contriving as you
can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Moss&rsquo;s tears came again at this unexpected kindness, and she could
say nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come!&mdash;the little wench shall come and see you. I&rsquo;ll
bring her and Tom some day before he goes to school. You mustn&rsquo;t fret.
I&rsquo;ll allays be a good brother to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you for that word, brother,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, drying her
tears; then turning to Lizzy, she said, &ldquo;Run now, and fetch the coloured
egg for cousin Maggie.&rdquo; Lizzy ran in, and quickly reappeared with a small
paper parcel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s boiled hard, brother, and coloured with thrums, very pretty;
it was done o&rsquo; purpose for Maggie. Will you please to carry it in your
pocket?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, putting it carefully in his side
pocket. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
And so the respectable miller returned along the Basset lanes rather more
puzzled than before as to ways and means, but still with the sense of a danger
escaped. It had come across his mind that if he were hard upon his sister, it
might somehow tend to make Tom hard upon Maggie at some distant day, when her
father was no longer there to take her part; for simple people, like our friend
Mr Tulliver, are apt to clothe unimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas, and
this was his confused way of explaining to himself that his love and anxiety
for &ldquo;the little wench&rdquo; had given him a new sensibility toward his
sister.

<h3><a name="chap09"></a>Chapter IX.<br/>
To Garum Firs</h3>

<p>
While the possible troubles of Maggie&rsquo;s future were occupying her
father&rsquo;s mind, she herself was tasting only the bitterness of the
present. Childhood has no forebodings; but then, it is soothed by no memories
of outlived sorrow.
</p>

<p>
The fact was, the day had begun ill with Maggie. The pleasure of having Lucy to
look at, and the prospect of the afternoon visit to Garum Firs, where she would
hear uncle Pullet&rsquo;s musical box, had been marred as early as eleven
o&rsquo;clock by the advent of the hair-dresser from St Ogg&rsquo;s, who had
spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which he had found her hair,
holding up one jagged lock after another and saying, &ldquo;See here! tut, tut,
tut!&rdquo; in a tone of mingled disgust and pity, which to Maggie&rsquo;s
imagination was equivalent to the strongest expression of public opinion. Mr
Rappit, the hair-dresser, with his well-anointed coronal locks tending wavily
upward, like the simulated pyramid of flame on a monumental urn, seemed to her
at that moment the most formidable of her contemporaries, into whose street at
St Ogg&rsquo;s she would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of
her life.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in the
Dodson family, Martha was enjoined to have Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s room ready an
hour earlier than usual, that the laying out of the best clothes might not be
deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes the case in families of lax
views, where the ribbon-strings were never rolled up, where there was little or
no wrapping in silver paper, and where the sense that the Sunday clothes could
be got at quite easily produced no shock to the mind. Already, at twelve
o&rsquo;clock, Mrs Tulliver had on her visiting costume, with a protective
apparatus of brown holland, as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in
danger of flies; Maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders, that she might
if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers, while her mother was
remonstrating, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Maggie, my dear; don&rsquo;t make yourself
so ugly!&rdquo; and Tom&rsquo;s cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a
relief to his best blue suit, which he wore with becoming calmness, having,
after a little wrangling, effected what was always the one point of interest to
him in his toilet: he had transferred all the contents of his everyday pockets
to those actually in wear.
</p>

<p>
As for Lucy, she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday; no
accidents ever happened to her clothes, and she was never uncomfortable in
them, so that she looked with wondering pity at Maggie, pouting and writhing
under the exasperating tucker. Maggie would certainly have torn it off, if she
had not been checked by the remembrance of her recent humiliation about her
hair; as it was, she confined herself to fretting and twisting, and behaving
peevishly about the card-houses which they were allowed to build till dinner,
as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes. Tom could
build perfect pyramids of houses; but Maggie&rsquo;s would never bear the
laying on the roof. It was always so with the things that Maggie made; and Tom
had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make anything. But it
happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at building; she handled the cards
so lightly, and moved so gently, that Tom condescended to admire her houses as
well as his own, the more readily because she had asked him to teach her.
Maggie, too, would have admired Lucy&rsquo;s houses, and would have given up
her own unsuccessful building to contemplate them, without ill temper, if her
tucker had not made her peevish, and if Tom had not inconsiderately laughed
when her houses fell, and told her she was &ldquo;a stupid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me, Tom!&rdquo; she burst out angrily;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a stupid. I know a great many things you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say, Miss Spitfire! I&rsquo;d never be such a cross thing as
you, making faces like that. Lucy doesn&rsquo;t do so. I like Lucy better than
you; <i>I</i> wish Lucy was <i>my</i> sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s very wicked and cruel of you to wish so,&rdquo; said
Maggie, starting up hurriedly from her place on the floor, and upsetting
Tom&rsquo;s wonderful pagoda. She really did not mean it, but the
circumstantial evidence was against her, and Tom turned white with anger, but
said nothing; he would have struck her, only he knew it was cowardly to strike
a girl, and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he would never do anything
cowardly.
</p>

<p>
Maggie stood in dismay and terror, while Tom got up from the floor and walked
away, pale, from the scattered ruins of his pagoda, and Lucy looked on mutely,
like a kitten pausing from its lapping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, at last, going half-way toward him,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to knock it down, indeed, indeed I
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom took no notice of her, but took, instead, two or three hard peas out of his
pocket, and shot them with his thumbnail against the window, vaguely at first,
but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a superannuated blue-bottle
which was exposing its imbecility in the spring sunshine, clearly against the
views of Nature, who had provided Tom and the peas for the speedy destruction
of this weak individual.
</p>

<p>
Thus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie, and Tom&rsquo;s persistent
coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for
her. He called Lucy to look at the half-built bird&rsquo;s nest without caring
to show it Maggie, and peeled a willow switch for Lucy and himself, without
offering one to Maggie. Lucy had said, &ldquo;Maggie, shouldn&rsquo;t
<i>you</i> like one?&rdquo; but Tom was deaf.
</p>

<p>
Still, the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the stackyard
wall, just as they reached Garum Firs, was enough to divert the mind
temporarily from personal grievances. And this was only the beginning of
beautiful sights at Garum Firs. All the farmyard life was wonderful
there,&mdash;bantams, speckled and top-knotted; Friesland hens, with their
feathers all turned the wrong way; Guinea-fowls that flew and screamed and
dropped their pretty spotted feathers; pouter-pigeons and a tame magpie; nay, a
goat, and a wonderful brindled dog, half mastiff, half bull-dog, as large as a
lion. Then there were white railings and white gates all about, and glittering
weathercocks of various design, and garden-walks paved with pebbles in
beautiful patterns,&mdash;nothing was quite common at Garum Firs; and Tom
thought that the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general
unusualness which characterised uncle Pullet&rsquo;s possessions as a gentleman
farmer. Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner. As for the house, it was not
less remarkable; it had a receding centre, and two wings with battlemented
turrets, and was covered with glittering white stucco.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window, and made
haste to unbar and unchain the front door, kept always in this fortified
condition from fear of tramps, who might be supposed to know of the glass case
of stuffed birds in the hall, and to contemplate rushing in and carrying it
away on their heads. Aunt Pullet, too, appeared at the doorway, and as soon as
her sister was within hearing said, &ldquo;Stop the children, for God&rsquo;s
sake! Bessy; don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em come up the door-steps; Sally&rsquo;s
bringing the old mat and the duster, to rub their shoes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet&rsquo;s front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes on;
the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work. Tom rebelled particularly
against this shoewiping, which he always considered in the light of an
indignity to his sex. He felt it as the beginning of the disagreeables incident
to a visit at aunt Pullet&rsquo;s, where he had once been compelled to sit with
towels wrapped round his boots; a fact which may serve to correct the too hasty
conclusion that a visit to Garum Firs must have been a great treat to a young
gentleman fond of animals,&mdash;fond, that is, of throwing stones at them.
</p>

<p>
The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions; it was the
mounting of the polished oak stairs, which had very handsome carpets rolled up
and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that the ascent of these glossy steps might
have served, in barbarous times, as a trial by ordeal from which none but the
most spotless virtue could have come off with unbroken limbs. Sophy&rsquo;s
weakness about these polished stairs was always a subject of bitter
remonstrance on Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s part; but Mrs Tulliver ventured on no
comment, only thinking to herself it was a mercy when she and the children were
safe on the landing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs Gray has sent home my new bonnet, Bessy,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet,
in a pathetic tone, as Mrs Tulliver adjusted her cap.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has she, sister?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, with an air of much
interest. &ldquo;And how do you like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s apt to make a mess with clothes, taking &rsquo;em out and
putting &rsquo;em in again,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys
from her pocket and looking at them earnestly, &ldquo;but it &rsquo;ud be a
pity for you to go away without seeing it. There&rsquo;s no knowing what may
happen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration, which
determined her to single out a particular key.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll be troublesome to you getting it out,
sister,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver; &ldquo;but I <i>should</i> like to see what
sort of a crown she&rsquo;s made you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very bright
wardrobe, where you may have hastily supposed she would find a new bonnet. Not
at all. Such a supposition could only have arisen from a too superficial
acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family. In this wardrobe Mrs Pullet
was seeking something small enough to be hidden among layers of linen,&mdash;it
was a door-key.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must come with me into the best room,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May the children come too, sister?&rdquo; inquired Mrs Tulliver, who
saw that Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, reflectively, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll perhaps
be safer for &rsquo;em to come; they&rsquo;ll be touching something if we leave
&rsquo;em behind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor, dimly
lighted by the semi-lunar top of the window which rose above the closed
shutter; it was really quite solemn. Aunt Pullet paused and unlocked a door
which opened on something still more solemn than the passage,&mdash;a darkened
room, in which the outer light, entering feebly, showed what looked like the
corpses of furniture in white shrouds. Everything that was not shrouded stood
with its legs upward. Lucy laid hold of Maggie&rsquo;s frock, and
Maggie&rsquo;s heart beat rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe, with a
melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the funereal
solemnity of the scene. The delicious scent of rose-leaves that issued from the
wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet after sheet of silver paper quite
pleasant to assist at, though the sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax
to Maggie, who would have preferred something more strikingly preternatural.
But few things could have been more impressive to Mrs Tulliver. She looked all
round it in silence for some moments, and then said emphatically, &ldquo;Well,
sister, I&rsquo;ll never speak against the full crowns again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a great concession, and Mrs Pullet felt it; she felt something was due
to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to see it on, sister?&rdquo; she said sadly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open the shutter a bit further.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t mind taking off your cap, sister,&rdquo; said
Mrs Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet took off her cap, displaying the brown silk scalp with a jutting
promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and judicious women of
those times, and placing the bonnet on her head, turned slowly round, like a
draper&rsquo;s lay-figure, that Mrs Tulliver might miss no point of view.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought there&rsquo;s a loop too much o&rsquo;
ribbon on this left side, sister; what do you think?&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated, and turned her head on
one side. &ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s best as it is; if you meddled with
it, sister, you might repent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, taking off the bonnet and
looking at it contemplatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How much might she charge you for that bonnet, sister?&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting a
humble imitation of this <i>chef-d&rsquo;œuvre</i> made from a piece of silk
she had at home.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head, and then whispered,
&ldquo;Pullet pays for it; he said I was to have the best bonnet at Garum
Church, let the next best be whose it would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She began slowly to adjust the trimmings, in preparation for returning it to
its place in the wardrobe, and her thoughts seemed to have taken a melancholy
turn, for she shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I may never wear it twice, sister;
who knows?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk o&rsquo; that sister,&rdquo; answered Mrs Tulliver.
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll have your health this summer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! but there may come a death in the family, as there did soon after I
had my green satin bonnet. Cousin Abbott may go, and we can&rsquo;t think
o&rsquo; wearing crape less nor half a year for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That <i>would</i> be unlucky,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, entering
thoroughly into the possibility of an inopportune decease. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
never so much pleasure i&rsquo; wearing a bonnet the second year, especially
when the crowns are so chancy,&mdash;never two summers alike.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s the way i&rsquo; this world,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet,
returning the bonnet to the wardrobe and locking it up. She maintained a
silence characterised by head-shaking, until they had all issued from the
solemn chamber and were in her own room again. Then, beginning to cry, she
said, &ldquo;Sister, if you should never see that bonnet again till I&rsquo;m
dead and gone, you&rsquo;ll remember I showed it you this day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver felt that she ought to be affected, but she was a woman of sparse
tears, stout and healthy; she couldn&rsquo;t cry so much as her sister Pullet
did, and had often felt her deficiency at funerals. Her effort to bring tears
into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face. Maggie, looking on
attentively, felt that there was some painful mystery about her aunt&rsquo;s
bonnet which she was considered too young to understand; indignantly conscious,
all the while, that she could have understood that, as well as everything else,
if she had been taken into confidence.
</p>

<p>
When they went down, uncle Pullet observed, with some acumen, that he reckoned
the missis had been showing her bonnet,&mdash;that was what had made them so
long upstairs. With Tom the interval had seemed still longer, for he had been
seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa directly opposite his uncle
Pullet, who regarded him with twinkling gray eyes, and occasionally addressed
him as &ldquo;Young sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, young sir, what do you learn at school?&rdquo; was a standing
question with uncle Pullet; whereupon Tom always looked sheepish, rubbed his
hands across his face, and answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; It was
altogether so embarrassing to be seated <i>tête-à-tête</i> with uncle Pullet,
that Tom could not even look at the prints on the walls, or the flycages, or
the wonderful flower-pots; he saw nothing but his uncle&rsquo;s gaiters. Not
that Tom was in awe of his uncle&rsquo;s mental superiority; indeed, he had
made up his mind that he didn&rsquo;t want to be a gentleman farmer, because he
shouldn&rsquo;t like to be such a thin-legged, silly fellow as his uncle
Pullet,&mdash;a molly-coddle, in fact. A boy&rsquo;s sheepishness is by no
means a sign of overmastering reverence; and while you are making encouraging
advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of your age
and wisdom, ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer. The only consolation
I can suggest to you is, that the Greek boys probably thought the same of
Aristotle. It is only when you have mastered a restive horse, or thrashed a
drayman, or have got a gun in your hand, that these shy juniors feel you to be
a truly admirable and enviable character. At least, I am quite sure of Tom
Tulliver&rsquo;s sentiments on these points. In very tender years, when he
still wore a lace border under his outdoor cap, he was often observed peeping
through the bars of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small
forefinger while he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr, intended to
strike terror into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire
for mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including
cockchafers, neighbours&rsquo; dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has
been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race. Now, Mr
Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony, and was the least predatory
of men, considering firearms dangerous, as apt to go off of themselves by
nobody&rsquo;s particular desire. So that Tom was not without strong reasons
when, in confidential talk with a chum, he had described uncle Pullet as a
nincompoop, taking care at the same time to observe that he was a very
&ldquo;rich fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The only alleviating circumstance in a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with uncle Pullet was
that he kept a variety of lozenges and peppermint-drops about his person, and
when at a loss for conversation, he filled up the void by proposing a mutual
solace of this kind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like peppermints, young sir?&rdquo; required only a tacit answer
when it was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the further solace
of small sweet-cakes, of which he also kept a stock under lock and key for his
own private eating on wet days; but the three children had no sooner got the
tempting delicacy between their fingers, than aunt Pullet desired them to
abstain from eating it till the tray and the plates came, since with those
crisp cakes they would make the floor &ldquo;all over&rdquo; crumbs. Lucy
didn&rsquo;t mind that much, for the cake was so pretty, she thought it was
rather a pity to eat it; but Tom, watching his opportunity while the elders
were talking, hastily stowed it in his mouth at two bites, and chewed it
furtively. As for Maggie, becoming fascinated, as usual, by a print of Ulysses
and Nausicaa, which uncle Pullet had bought as a &ldquo;pretty Scripture
thing,&rdquo; she presently let fall her cake, and in an unlucky movement
crushed it beneath her foot,&mdash;a source of so much agitation to aunt Pullet
and conscious disgrace to Maggie, that she began to despair of hearing the
musical snuff-box to-day, till, after some reflection, it occurred to her that
Lucy was in high favour enough to venture on asking for a tune. So she whispered
to Lucy; and Lucy, who always did what she was desired to do, went up quietly
to her uncle&rsquo;s knee, and blush-all over her neck while she fingered her
necklace, said, &ldquo;Will you please play us a tune, uncle?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle Pullet that
the snuff-box played such beautiful tunes, and indeed the thing was viewed in
that light by the majority of his neighbours in Garum. Mr Pullet had
<i>bought</i> the box, to begin with, and he understood winding it up, and knew
which tune it was going to play beforehand; altogether the possession of this
unique &ldquo;piece of music&rdquo; was a proof that Mr Pullet&rsquo;s
character was not of that entire nullity which might otherwise have been
attributed to it. But uncle Pullet, when entreated to exhibit his
accomplishment, never depreciated it by a too ready consent. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
see about it,&rdquo; was the answer he always gave, carefully abstaining from
any sign of compliance till a suitable number of minutes had passed. Uncle
Pullet had a programme for all great social occasions, and in this way fenced
himself in from much painful confusion and perplexing freedom of will.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie&rsquo;s enjoyment when the fairy tune
began; for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mind,
that Tom was angry with her; and by the time &ldquo;Hush, ye pretty warbling
choir,&rdquo; had been played, her face wore that bright look of happiness,
while she sat immovable with her hands clasped, which sometimes comforted her
mother with the sense that Maggie could look pretty now and then, in spite of
her brown skin. But when the magic music ceased, she jumped up, and running
toward Tom, put her arm round his neck and said, &ldquo;Oh, Tom, isn&rsquo;t it
pretty?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that he felt
any new anger toward Maggie for this uncalled-for and, to him, inexplicable
caress, I must tell you that he had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand, and
that she jerked him so as to make him spill half of it. He must have been an
extreme milksop not to say angrily, &ldquo;Look there, now!&rdquo; especially
when his resentment was sanctioned, as it was, by general disapprobation of
Maggie&rsquo;s behaviour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit still, Maggie?&rdquo; her mother said peevishly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Little gells mustn&rsquo;t come to see me if they behave in that
way,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re too rough, little miss,&rdquo; said uncle Pullet.
</p>

<p>
Poor Maggie sat down again, with the music all chased out of her soul, and the
seven small demons all in again.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver, foreseeing nothing but misbehaviour while the children remained
indoors, took an early opportunity of suggesting that, now they were rested
after their walk, they might go and play out of doors; and aunt Pullet gave
permission, only enjoining them not to go off the paved walks in the garden,
and if they wanted to see the poultry fed, to view them from a distance on the
horse-block; a restriction which had been imposed ever since Tom had been found
guilty of running after the peacock, with an illusory idea that fright would
make one of its feathers drop off.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel
with Mrs Glegg by millinery and maternal cares, but now the great theme of the
bonnet was thrown into perspective, and the children were out of the way,
yesterday&rsquo;s anxieties recurred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It weighs on my mind so as never was,&rdquo; she said, by way of opening
the subject, &ldquo;sister Glegg&rsquo;s leaving the house in that way.
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d no wish t&rsquo; offend a sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no accounting for what
Jane &rsquo;ull do. I wouldn&rsquo;t speak of it out o&rsquo; the family, if it
wasn&rsquo;t to Dr Turnbull; but it&rsquo;s my belief Jane lives too low.
I&rsquo;ve said so to Pullet often and often, and he knows it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you said so last Monday was a week, when we came away from drinking
tea with &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Mr Pullet, beginning to nurse his knee and
shelter it with his pocket handkerchief, as was his way when the conversation
took an interesting turn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very like I did,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, &ldquo;for you remember when I
said things, better than I can remember myself. He&rsquo;s got a wonderful
memory, Pullet has,&rdquo; she continued, looking pathetically at her sister.
&ldquo;I should be poorly off if he was to have a stroke, for he always
remembers when I&rsquo;ve got to take my doctor&rsquo;s stuff; and I&rsquo;m
taking three sorts now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the &lsquo;pills as before&rsquo; every other night, and
the new drops at eleven and four, and the &rsquo;fervescing mixture &lsquo;when
agreeable,&rsquo;&rdquo; rehearsed Mr Pullet, with a punctuation determined by
a lozenge on his tongue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, perhaps it &rsquo;ud be better for sister Glegg if
<i>she&rsquo;d</i> go to the doctor sometimes, instead o&rsquo; chewing Turkey
rhubarb whenever there&rsquo;s anything the matter with her,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, who naturally saw the wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to
Mrs Glegg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful to think on,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, raising her
hands and letting them fall again, &ldquo;people playing with their own insides
in that way! And it&rsquo;s flying i&rsquo; the face o&rsquo; Providence; for
what are the doctors for, if we aren&rsquo;t to call &rsquo;em in? And when
folks have got the money to pay for a doctor, it isn&rsquo;t respectable, as
I&rsquo;ve told Jane many a time. I&rsquo;m ashamed of acquaintance knowing
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, <i>we&rsquo;ve</i> no call to be ashamed,&rdquo; said Mr Pullet,
&ldquo;for Doctor Turnbull hasn&rsquo;t got such another patient as you
i&rsquo; this parish, now old Mrs Sutton&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pullet keeps all my physic-bottles, did you know, Bessy?&rdquo; said
Mrs Pullet. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have one sold. He says it&rsquo;s nothing
but right folks should see &rsquo;em when I&rsquo;m gone. They fill two
o&rsquo; the long store-room shelves a&rsquo;ready; but,&rdquo; she added,
beginning to cry a little, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s well if they ever fill three. I
may go before I&rsquo;ve made up the dozen o&rsquo; these last sizes. The
pill-boxes are in the closet in my room,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll remember that,
sister,&mdash;but there&rsquo;s nothing to show for the boluses, if it
isn&rsquo;t the bills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk o&rsquo; your going, sister,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver;
&ldquo;I should have nobody to stand between me and sister Glegg if you was
gone. And there&rsquo;s nobody but you can get her to make it up with Mr
Tulliver, for sister Deane&rsquo;s never o&rsquo; my side, and if she was,
it&rsquo;s not to be looked for as she can speak like them as have got an
independent fortin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, your husband <i>is</i> awk&rsquo;ard, you know, Bessy,&rdquo; said
Mrs Pullet, good-naturedly ready to use her deep depression on her
sister&rsquo;s account as well as her own. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never behaved
quite so pretty to our family as he should do, and the children take after
him,&mdash;the boy&rsquo;s very mischievous, and runs away from his aunts and
uncles, and the gell&rsquo;s rude and brown. It&rsquo;s your bad luck, and
I&rsquo;m sorry for you, Bessy; for you was allays my favourite sister, and we
allays liked the same patterns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know Tulliver&rsquo;s hasty, and says odd things,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, wiping away one small tear from the corner of her eye; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s never been the man, since he married me, to object to
my making the friends o&rsquo; my side o&rsquo; the family welcome to the
house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to make the worst of you, Bessy,&rdquo; said
Mrs Pullet, compassionately, &ldquo;for I doubt you&rsquo;ll have trouble
enough without that; and your husband&rsquo;s got that poor sister and her
children hanging on him,&mdash;and so given to lawing, they say. I doubt
he&rsquo;ll leave you poorly off when he dies. Not as I&rsquo;d have it said
out o&rsquo; the family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This view of her position was naturally far from cheering to Mrs Tulliver. Her
imagination was not easily acted on, but she could not help thinking that her
case was a hard one, since it appeared that other people thought it hard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, sister, I can&rsquo;t help myself,&rdquo; she said,
urged by the fear lest her anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive,
to take comprehensive review of her past conduct. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no woman
strives more for her children; and I&rsquo;m sure at scouring-time this
Lady-day as I&rsquo;ve had all the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the
two gells put together; and there&rsquo;s the last elder-flower wine I&rsquo;ve
made&mdash;beautiful! I allays offer it along with the sherry, though sister
Glegg will have it I&rsquo;m so extravagant; and as for liking to have my
clothes tidy, and not go a fright about the house, there&rsquo;s nobody in the
parish can say anything against me in respect o&rsquo; backbiting and making
mischief, for I don&rsquo;t wish anybody any harm; and nobody loses by sending
me a porkpie, for my pies are fit to show with the best o&rsquo; my
neighbours&rsquo;; and the linen&rsquo;s so in order as if I was to die
to-morrow I shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed. A woman can do no more nor she
can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all o&rsquo; no use, you know, Bessy,&rdquo; said Mrs
Pullet, holding her head on one side, and fixing her eyes pathetically on her
sister, &ldquo;if your husband makes away with his money. Not but what if you
was sold up, and other folks bought your furniture, it&rsquo;s a comfort to
think as you&rsquo;ve kept it well rubbed. And there&rsquo;s the linen, with
your maiden mark on, might go all over the country. It &rsquo;ud be a sad pity
for our family.&rdquo; Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what can I do, sister?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver. &ldquo;Mr
Tulliver&rsquo;s not a man to be dictated to,&mdash;not if I was to go to the
parson and get by heart what I should tell my husband for the best. And
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t pretend to know anything about putting out money
and all that. I could never see into men&rsquo;s business as sister Glegg
does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re like me in that, Bessy,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet;
&ldquo;and I think it &rsquo;ud be a deal more becoming o&rsquo; Jane if
she&rsquo;d have that pier-glass rubbed oftener,&mdash;there was ever so many
spots on it last week,&mdash;instead o&rsquo; dictating to folks as have more
comings in than she ever had, and telling &rsquo;em what they&rsquo;re to do
with their money. But Jane and me were allays contrairy; she <i>would</i> have
striped things, and I like spots. You like a spot too, Bessy; we allays hung
together i&rsquo; that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Sophy,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, &ldquo;I remember our having a
blue ground with a white spot both alike,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a bit in a
bed-quilt now; and if you would but go and see sister Glegg, and persuade her
to make it up with Tulliver, I should take it very kind of you. You was allays
a good sister to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the right thing &rsquo;ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with
her himself, and say he was sorry for speaking so rash. If he&rsquo;s borrowed
money of her, he shouldn&rsquo;t be above that,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, whose
partiality did not blind her to principles; she did not forget what was due to
people of independent fortune.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talking o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said poor Mrs Tulliver,
almost peevishly. &ldquo;If I was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to
Tulliver, he&rsquo;d never humble himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t expect me to persuade <i>Jane</i> to beg
pardon,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet. &ldquo;Her temper&rsquo;s beyond everything;
it&rsquo;s well if it doesn&rsquo;t carry her off her mind, though there never
<i>was</i> any of our family went to a madhouse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of her begging pardon,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver.
&ldquo;But if she&rsquo;d just take no notice, and not call her money in; as
it&rsquo;s not so much for one sister to ask of another; time &rsquo;ud mend
things, and Tulliver &rsquo;ud forget all about it, and they&rsquo;d be friends
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver, you perceive, was not aware of her husband&rsquo;s irrevocable
determination to pay in the five hundred pounds; at least such a determination
exceeded her powers of belief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bessy,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, mournfully, &ldquo;<i>I</i>
don&rsquo;t want to help you on to ruin. I won&rsquo;t be behindhand i&rsquo;
doing you a good turn, if it is to be done. And I don&rsquo;t like it said
among acquaintance as we&rsquo;ve got quarrels in the family. I shall tell Jane
that; and I don&rsquo;t mind driving to Jane&rsquo;s tomorrow, if Pullet
doesn&rsquo;t mind. What do you say, Mr Pullet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objections,&rdquo; said Mr Pullet, who was perfectly
contented with any course the quarrel might take, so that Mr Tulliver did not
apply to <i>him</i> for money. Mr Pullet was nervous about his investments,
and did not see how a man could have any security for his money unless he
turned it into land.
</p>

<p>
After a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better for Mrs
Tulliver to accompany them on a visit to sister Glegg, Mrs Pullet, observing
that it was tea-time, turned to reach from a drawer a delicate damask napkin,
which she pinned before her in the fashion of an apron. The door did, in fact,
soon open, but instead of the tea-tray, Sally introduced an object so startling
that both Mrs Pullet and Mrs Tulliver gave a scream, causing uncle Pullet to
swallow his lozenge&mdash;for the fifth time in his life, as he afterward
noted.
</p>

<h3><a name="chap10"></a>Chapter X.<br/>
Maggie Behaves Worse Than She Expected</h3>

<p>
The startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle Pullet was no other
than little Lucy, with one side of her person, from her small foot to her
bonnet-crown, wet and discoloured with mud, holding out two tiny blackened
hands, and making a very piteous face. To account for this unprecedented
apparition in aunt Pullet&rsquo;s parlour, we must return to the moment when the
three children went to play out of doors, and the small demons who had taken
possession of Maggie&rsquo;s soul at an early period of the day had returned in
all the greater force after a temporary absence. All the disagreeable
recollections of the morning were thick upon her, when Tom, whose displeasure
toward her had been considerably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him
to upset his cowslip wine, said, &ldquo;Here, Lucy, you come along with
me,&rdquo; and walked off to the area where the toads were, as if there were no
Maggie in existence. Seeing this, Maggie lingered at a distance, looking like a
small Medusa with her snakes cropped. Lucy was naturally pleased that cousin
Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad
with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area, with an iron
grating over him. Still Lucy wished Maggie to enjoy the spectacle also,
especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad, and say what had
been his past history; for Lucy had a delighted semibelief in Maggie&rsquo;s
stories about the live things they came upon by accident,&mdash;how Mrs Earwig
had a wash at home, and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper, for
which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor. Tom had a profound
contempt for this nonsense of Maggie&rsquo;s, smashing the earwig at once as a
superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story; but
Lucy, for the life of her, could not help fancying there was something in it,
and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe. So now the desire to
know the history of a very portly toad, added to her habitual affectionateness,
made her run back to Maggie and say, &ldquo;Oh, there is such a big, funny
toad, Maggie! Do come and see!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie said nothing, but turned away from her with a deeper frown. As long as
Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her, Lucy made part of his unkindness. Maggie
would have thought a little while ago that she could never be cross with pretty
little Lucy, any more than she could be cruel to a little white mouse; but
then, Tom had always been quite indifferent to Lucy before, and it had been
left to Maggie to pet and make much of her. As it was, she was actually
beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or
pinching her, especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap,
even if she dared, because he didn&rsquo;t mind it. And if Lucy hadn&rsquo;t
been there, Maggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner.
</p>

<p>
Tickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that it is
possible to exhaust, and Tom by and by began to look round for some other mode
of passing the time. But in so prim a garden, where they were not to go off the
paved walks, there was not a great choice of sport. The only great pleasure
such a restriction suggested was the pleasure of breaking it, and Tom began to
meditate an insurrectionary visit to the pond, about a field&rsquo;s length
beyond the garden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Lucy,&rdquo; he began, nodding his head up and down with great
significance, as he coiled up his string again, &ldquo;what do you think I mean
to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, Tom?&rdquo; said Lucy, with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean to go to the pond and look at the pike. You may go with me if you
like,&rdquo; said the young sultan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom, <i>dare</i> you?&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Aunt said we
mustn&rsquo;t go out of the garden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I shall go out at the other end of the garden,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;Nobody &rsquo;ull see us. Besides, I don&rsquo;t care if they
do,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll run off home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t run,&rdquo; said Lucy, who had never before
been exposed to such severe temptation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, never mind; they won&rsquo;t be cross with <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;You say I took you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom walked along, and Lucy trotted by his side, timidly enjoying the rare treat
of doing something naughty,&mdash;excited also by the mention of that
celebrity, the pike, about which she was quite uncertain whether it was a fish
or a fowl.
</p>

<p>
Maggie saw them leaving the garden, and could not resist the impulse to follow.
Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love,
and that Tom and Lucy should do or see anything of which she was ignorant would
have been an intolerable idea to Maggie. So she kept a few yards behind them,
unobserved by Tom, who was presently absorbed in watching for the pike,&mdash;a
highly interesting monster; he was said to be so very old, so very large, and
to have such a remarkable appetite. The pike, like other celebrities, did not
show when he was watched for, but Tom caught sight of something in rapid
movement in the water, which attracted him to another spot on the brink of the
pond.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, Lucy!&rdquo; he said in a loud whisper, &ldquo;come here! take
care! keep on the grass!&mdash;don&rsquo;t step where the cows have
been!&rdquo; he added, pointing to a peninsula of dry grass, with trodden mud
on each side of it; for Tom&rsquo;s contemptuous conception of a girl included
the attribute of being unfit to walk in dirty places.
</p>

<p>
Lucy came carefully as she was bidden, and bent down to look at what seemed a
golden arrow-head darting through the water. It was a water-snake, Tom told
her; and Lucy at last could see the serpentine wave of its body, very much
wondering that a snake could swim. Maggie had drawn nearer and nearer; she
<i>must</i> see it too, though it was bitter to her, like everything else,
since Tom did not care about her seeing it. At last she was close by Lucy; and
Tom, who had been aware of her approach, but would not notice it till he was
obliged, turned round and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, get away, Maggie; there&rsquo;s no room for you on the grass here.
Nobody asked <i>you</i> to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were passions at war in Maggie at that moment to have made a tragedy, if
tragedies were made by passion only; but the essential &tau;&iota;
&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&theta;&omega;&sigmaf; which was present in the
passion was wanting to the action; the utmost Maggie could do, with a fierce
thrust of her small brown arm, was to push poor little pink-and-white Lucy into
the cow-trodden mud.
</p>

<p>
Then Tom could not restrain himself, and gave Maggie two smart slaps on the arm
as he ran to pick up Lucy, who lay crying helplessly. Maggie retreated to the
roots of a tree a few yards off, and looked on impenitently. Usually her
repentance came quickly after one rash deed, but now Tom and Lucy had made her
so miserable, she was glad to spoil their happiness,&mdash;glad to make
everybody uncomfortable. Why should she be sorry? Tom was very slow to forgive
<i>her</i>, however sorry she might have been.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall tell mother, you know, Miss Mag,&rdquo; said Tom, loudly and
emphatically, as soon as Lucy was up and ready to walk away. It was not
Tom&rsquo;s practice to &ldquo;tell,&rdquo; but here justice clearly demanded
that Maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment; not that Tom had
learned to put his views in that abstract form; he never mentioned
&ldquo;justice,&rdquo; and had no idea that his desire to punish might be
called by that fine name. Lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had
befallen her,&mdash;the spoiling of her pretty best clothes, and the discomfort
of being wet and dirty,&mdash;to think much of the cause, which was entirely
mysterious to her. She could never have guessed what she had done to make
Maggie angry with her; but she felt that Maggie was very unkind and
disagreeable, and made no magnanimous entreaties to Tom that he would not
&ldquo;tell,&rdquo; only running along by his side and crying piteously, while
Maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked after them with her small Medusa
face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sally,&rdquo; said Tom, when they reached the kitchen door, and Sally
looked at them in speechless amaze, with a piece of bread-and-butter in her
mouth and a toasting-fork in her hand,&mdash;&ldquo;Sally, tell mother it was
Maggie pushed Lucy into the mud.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Lors ha&rsquo; massy, how did you get near such mud as that?&rdquo;
said Sally, making a wry face, as she stooped down and examined the <i>corpus
delicti</i>.
</p>

<p>
Tom&rsquo;s imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include this
question among the foreseen consequences, but it was no sooner put than he
foresaw whither it tended, and that Maggie would not be considered the only
culprit in the case. He walked quietly away from the kitchen door, leaving
Sally to that pleasure of guessing which active minds notoriously prefer to
ready-made knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Sally, as you are aware, lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlour door,
for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at Garum Firs was too
great a weight to be sustained by a single mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; aunt Pullet exclaimed, after preluding by an
inarticulate scream; &ldquo;keep her at the door, Sally! Don&rsquo;t bring her
off the oil-cloth, whatever you do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s tumbled into some nasty mud,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver,
going up to Lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she
felt herself responsible to her sister Deane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you please, &rsquo;um, it was Miss Maggie as pushed her in,&rdquo;
said Sally; &ldquo;Master Tom&rsquo;s been and said so, and they must ha&rsquo;
been to the pond, for it&rsquo;s only there they could ha&rsquo; got into such
dirt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There it is, Bessy; it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been telling you,&rdquo;
said Mrs Pullet, in a tone of prophetic sadness; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your
children,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no knowing what they&rsquo;ll come to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver was mute, feeling herself a truly wretched mother. As usual, the
thought pressed upon her that people would think she had done something wicked
to deserve her maternal troubles, while Mrs Pullet began to give elaborate
directions to Sally how to guard the premises from serious injury in the course
of removing the dirt. Meantime tea was to be brought in by the cook, and the
two naughty children were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the
kitchen. Mrs Tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children, supposing
them to be close at hand; but it was not until after some search that she found
Tom leaning with rather a hardened, careless air against the white paling of
the poultry-yard, and lowering his piece of string on the other side as a means
of exasperating the turkey-cock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom, you naughty boy, where&rsquo;s your sister?&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, in a distressed voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tom; his eagerness for justice on Maggie
had diminished since he had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought about
without the injustice of some blame on his own conduct.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, where did you leave her?&rdquo; said the mother, looking round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sitting under the tree, against the pond,&rdquo; said Tom, apparently
indifferent to everything but the string and the turkey-cock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then go and fetch her in this minute, you naughty boy. And how could you
think o&rsquo; going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?
You know she&rsquo;ll do mischief if there&rsquo;s mischief to be done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s way, if she blamed Tom, to refer his misdemeanour,
somehow or other, to Maggie.
</p>

<p>
The idea of Maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear in Mrs
Tulliver&rsquo;s mind, and she mounted the horse-block to satisfy herself by a
sight of that fatal child, while Tom walked&mdash;not very quickly&mdash;on his
way toward her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re such children for the water, mine are,&rdquo; she said
aloud, without reflecting that there was no one to hear her;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be brought in dead and drownded some day. I wish that
river was far enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But when she not only failed to discern Maggie, but presently saw Tom returning
from the pool alone, this hovering fear entered and took complete possession of
her, and she hurried to meet him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie&rsquo;s nowhere about the pond, mother,&rdquo; said Tom;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s gone away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
You may conceive the terrified search for Maggie, and the difficulty of
convincing her mother that she was not in the pond. Mrs Pullet observed that
the child might come to a worse end if she lived, there was no knowing; and Mr
Pullet, confused and overwhelmed by this revolutionary aspect of
things,&mdash;the tea deferred and the poultry alarmed by the unusual running
to and fro,&mdash;took up his spud as an instrument of search, and reached down
a key to unlock the goose-pen, as a likely place for Maggie to lie concealed
in.
</p>

<p>
Tom, after a while, started the idea that Maggie was gone home (without
thinking it necessary to state that it was what he should have done himself
under the circumstances), and the suggestion was seized as a comfort by his
mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister, for goodness&rsquo; sake let &rsquo;em put the horse in the
carriage and take me home; we shall perhaps find her on the road. Lucy
can&rsquo;t walk in her dirty clothes,&rdquo; she said, looking at that
innocent victim, who was wrapped up in a shawl, and sitting with naked feet on
the sofa.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Pullet was quite willing to take the shortest means of restoring her
premises to order and quiet, and it was not long before Mrs Tulliver was in
the chaise, looking anxiously at the most distant point before her. What the
father would say if Maggie was lost, was a question that predominated over
every other.

Maggie Tries to Run away from Her Shadow</h3>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s intentions, as usual, were on a larger scale than Tom imagined.
The resolution that gathered in her mind, after Tom and Lucy had walked away,
was not so simple as that of going home. No! she would run away and go to the
gypsies, and Tom should never see her any more. That was by no means a new idea
to Maggie; she had been so often told she was like a gypsy, and &ldquo;half
wild,&rdquo; that when she was miserable it seemed to her the only way of
escaping opprobrium, and being entirely in harmony with circumstances, would be
to live in a little brown tent on the commons; the gypsies, she considered,
would gladly receive her and pay her much respect on account of her superior
knowledge. She had once mentioned her views on this point to Tom and suggested
that he should stain his face brown, and they should run away together; but Tom
rejected the scheme with contempt, observing that gypsies were thieves, and
hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey. To-day
however, Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gypsydom was
her refuge, and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense
that this was a great crisis in her life; she would run straight away till she
came to Dunlow Common, where there would certainly be gypsies; and cruel Tom,
and the rest of her relations who found fault with her, should never see her
any more. She thought of her father as she ran along, but she reconciled
herself to the idea of parting with him, by determining that she would secretly
send him a letter by a small gypsy, who would run away without telling where
she was, and just let him know that she was well and happy, and always loved
him very much.
</p>

<p>
Maggie soon got out of breath with running, but by the time Tom got to the pond
again she was at the distance of three long fields, and was on the edge of the
lane leading to the highroad. She stopped to pant a little, reflecting that
running away was not a pleasant thing until one had got quite to the common
where the gypsies were, but her resolution had not abated; she presently passed
through the gate into the lane, not knowing where it would lead her, for it was
not this way that they came from Dorlcote Mill to Garum Firs, and she felt all
the safer for that, because there was no chance of her being overtaken. But she
was soon aware, not without trembling, that there were two men coming along the
lane in front of her; she had not thought of meeting strangers, she had been
too much occupied with the idea of her friends coming after her. The formidable
strangers were two shabby-looking men with flushed faces, one of them carrying
a bundle on a stick over his shoulder; but to her surprise, while she was
dreading their disapprobation as a runaway, the man with the bundle stopped,
and in a half-whining, half-coaxing tone asked her if she had a copper to give
a poor man. Maggie had a sixpence in her pocket,&mdash;her uncle Glegg&rsquo;s
present,&mdash;which she immediately drew out and gave this poor man with a
polite smile, hoping he would feel very kindly toward her as a generous person.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only money I&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; she said
apologetically. &ldquo;Thank you, little miss,&rdquo; said the man, in a less
respectful and grateful tone than Maggie anticipated, and she even observed
that he smiled and winked at his companion. She walked on hurriedly, but was
aware that the two men were standing still, probably to look after her, and she
presently heard them laughing loudly. Suddenly it occurred to her that they
might think she was an idiot; Tom had said that her cropped hair made her look
like an idiot, and it was too painful an idea to be readily forgotten. Besides,
she had no sleeves on,&mdash;only a cape and bonnet. It was clear that she was
not likely to make a favourable impression on passengers, and she thought she
would turn into the fields again, but not on the same side of the lane as
before, lest they should still be uncle Pullet&rsquo;s fields. She turned
through the first gate that was not locked, and felt a delightful sense of
privacy in creeping along by the hedgerows, after her recent humiliating
encounter. She was used to wandering about the fields by herself, and was less
timid there than on the highroad. Sometimes she had to climb over high gates,
but that was a small evil; she was getting out of reach very fast, and she
should probably soon come within sight of Dunlow Common, or at least of some
other common, for she had heard her father say that you couldn&rsquo;t go very
far without coming to a common. She hoped so, for she was getting rather tired
and hungry, and until she reached the gypsies there was no definite prospect of
bread and butter. It was still broad daylight, for aunt Pullet, retaining the
early habits of the Dodson family, took tea at half-past four by the sun, and
at five by the kitchen clock; so, though it was nearly an hour since Maggie
started, there was no gathering gloom on the fields to remind her that the
night would come. Still, it seemed to her that she had been walking a very
great distance indeed, and it was really surprising that the common did not
come within sight. Hitherto she had been in the rich parish of Garum, where was
a great deal of pasture-land, and she had only seen one labourer at a distance.
That was fortunate in some respects, as labourers might be too ignorant to
understand the propriety of her wanting to go to Dunlow Common; yet it would
have been better if she could have met some one who would tell her the way
without wanting to know anything about her private business. At last, however,
the green fields came to an end, and Maggie found herself looking through the
bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it. She
had never seen such a wide lane before, and, without her knowing why, it gave
her the impression that the common could not be far off; perhaps it was because
she saw a donkey with a log to his foot feeding on the grassy margin, for she
had seen a donkey with that pitiable encumbrance on Dunlow Common when she had
been across it in her father&rsquo;s gig. She crept through the bars of the
gate and walked on with new spirit, though not without haunting images of
Apollyon, and a highwayman with a pistol, and a blinking dwarf in yellow with a
mouth from ear to ear, and other miscellaneous dangers. For poor little Maggie
had at once the timidity of an active imagination and the daring that comes
from overmastering impulse. She had rushed into the adventure of seeking her
unknown kindred, the gypsies; and now she was in this strange lane, she hardly
dared look on one side of her, lest she should see the diabolical blacksmith in
his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo. It was not without a
leaping of the heart that she caught sight of a small pair of bare legs
sticking up, feet uppermost, by the side of a hillock; they seemed something
hideously preternatural,&mdash;a diabolical kind of fungus; for she was too
much agitated at the first glance to see the ragged clothes and the dark shaggy
head attached to them. It was a boy asleep, and Maggie trotted along faster and
more lightly, lest she should wake him; it did not occur to her that he was one
of her friends the gypsies, who in all probability would have very genial
manners. But the fact was so, for at the next bend in the lane Maggie actually
saw the little semicircular black tent with the blue smoke rising before it,
which was to be her refuge from all the blighting obloquy that had pursued her
in civilised life. She even saw a tall female figure by the column of smoke,
doubtless the gypsy-mother, who provided the tea and other groceries; it was
astonishing to herself that she did not feel more delighted. But it was
startling to find the gypsies in a lane, after all, and not on a common;
indeed, it was rather disappointing; for a mysterious illimitable common, where
there were sand-pits to hide in, and one was out of everybody&rsquo;s reach,
had always made part of Maggie&rsquo;s picture of gypsy life. She went on,
however, and thought with some comfort that gypsies most likely knew nothing
about idiots, so there was no danger of their falling into the mistake of
setting her down at the first glance as an idiot. It was plain she had
attracted attention; for the tall figure, who proved to be a young woman with a
baby on her arm, walked slowly to meet her. Maggie looked up in the new face
rather tremblingly as it approached, and was reassured by the thought that her
aunt Pullet and the rest were right when they called her a gypsy; for this
face, with the bright dark eyes and the long hair, was really something like
what she used to see in the glass before she cut her hair off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My little lady, where are you going to?&rdquo; the gypsy said, in a tone
of coaxing deference.
</p>

<p>
It was delightful, and just what Maggie expected; the gypsies saw at once that
she was a little lady, and were prepared to treat her accordingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not any farther,&rdquo; said Maggie, feeling as if she were saying what
she had rehearsed in a dream. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m come to stay with <i>you</i>,
please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty; come, then. Why, what a nice little lady you are,
to be sure!&rdquo; said the gypsy, taking her by the hand. Maggie thought her
very agreeable, but wished she had not been so dirty.
</p>

<p>
There was quite a group round the fire when she reached it. An old gypsy woman
was seated on the ground nursing her knees, and occasionally poking a skewer
into the round kettle that sent forth an odorous steam; two small shock-headed
children were lying prone and resting on their elbows something like small
sphinxes; and a placid donkey was bending his head over a tall girl, who, lying
on her back, was scratching his nose and indulging him with a bite of excellent
stolen hay. The slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them, and the scene was
really very pretty and comfortable, Maggie thought, only she hoped they would
soon set out the tea-cups. Everything would be quite charming when she had
taught the gypsies to use a washing-basin, and to feel an interest in books. It
was a little confusing, though, that the young woman began to speak to the old
one in a language which Maggie did not understand, while the tall girl, who was
feeding the donkey, sat up and stared at her without offering any salutation.
At last the old woman said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! my pretty lady, are you come to stay with us? Sit ye down and tell
us where you come from.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was just like a story; Maggie liked to be called pretty lady and treated in
this way. She sat down and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m come from home because I&rsquo;m unhappy, and I mean to be a
gypsy. I&rsquo;ll live with you if you like, and I can teach you a great many
things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such a clever little lady,&rdquo; said the woman with the baby sitting
down by Maggie, and allowing baby to crawl; &ldquo;and such a pretty bonnet and
frock,&rdquo; she added, taking off Maggie&rsquo;s bonnet and looking at it
while she made an observation to the old woman, in the unknown language. The
tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hind-foremost with a
grin; but Maggie was determined not to show any weakness on this subject, as if
she were susceptible about her bonnet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to wear a bonnet,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather wear a red handkerchief, like yours&rdquo; (looking at her friend by her
side). &ldquo;My hair was quite long till yesterday, when I cut it off; but I
dare say it will grow again very soon,&rdquo; she added apologetically,
thinking it probable the gypsies had a strong prejudice in favour of long hair.
And Maggie had forgotten even her hunger at that moment in the desire to
conciliate gypsy opinion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what a nice little lady!&mdash;and rich, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said
the old woman. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you live in a beautiful house at
home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my home is pretty, and I&rsquo;m very fond of the river, where we
go fishing, but I&rsquo;m often very unhappy. I should have liked to bring my
books with me, but I came away in a hurry, you know. But I can tell you almost
everything there is in my books, I&rsquo;ve read them so many times, and that
will amuse you. And I can tell you something about Geography
too,&mdash;that&rsquo;s about the world we live in,&mdash;very useful and
interesting. Did you ever hear about Columbus?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s eyes had begun to sparkle and her cheeks to flush,&mdash;she was
really beginning to instruct the gypsies, and gaining great influence over
them. The gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this talk, though
their attention was divided by the contents of Maggie&rsquo;s pocket, which the
friend at her right hand had by this time emptied without attracting her
notice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that where you live, my little lady?&rdquo; said the old woman, at
the mention of Columbus.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Maggie, with some pity; &ldquo;Columbus was a very
wonderful man, who found out half the world, and they put chains on him and
treated him very badly, you know; it&rsquo;s in my Catechism of Geography, but
perhaps it&rsquo;s rather too long to tell before tea&mdash;<i>I want my tea
so</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The last words burst from Maggie, in spite of herself, with a sudden drop from
patronizing instruction to simple peevishness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s hungry, poor little lady,&rdquo; said the younger
woman. &ldquo;Give her some o&rsquo; the cold victual. You&rsquo;ve been
walking a good way, I&rsquo;ll be bound, my dear. Where&rsquo;s your
home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dorlcote Mill, a good way off,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;My
father is Mr Tulliver, but we mustn&rsquo;t let him know where I am, else
he&rsquo;ll fetch me home again. Where does the queen of the gypsies
live?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! do you want to go to her, my little lady?&rdquo; said the younger
woman. The tall girl meanwhile was constantly staring at Maggie and grinning.
Her manners were certainly not agreeable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only thinking that if she
isn&rsquo;t a very good queen you might be glad when she died, and you could
choose another. If I was a queen, I&rsquo;d be a very good queen, and kind to
everybody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bit o&rsquo; nice victual, then,&rdquo; said the old
woman, handing to Maggie a lump of dry bread, which she had taken from a bag of
scraps, and a piece of cold bacon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Maggie, looking at the food without taking it;
&ldquo;but will you give me some bread-and-butter and tea instead? I
don&rsquo;t like bacon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got no tea nor butter,&rdquo; said the old woman, with
something like a scowl, as if she were getting tired of coaxing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, a little bread and treacle would do,&rdquo; said Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We han&rsquo;t got no treacle,&rdquo; said the old woman, crossly,
whereupon there followed a sharp dialogue between the two women in their
unknown tongue, and one of the small sphinxes snatched at the bread-and-bacon,
and began to eat it. At this moment the tall girl, who had gone a few yards
off, came back, and said something which produced a strong effect. The old
woman, seeming to forget Maggie&rsquo;s hunger, poked the skewer into the pot
with new vigor, and the younger crept under the tent and reached out some
platters and spoons. Maggie trembled a little, and was afraid the tears would
come into her eyes. Meanwhile the tall girl gave a shrill cry, and presently
came running up the boy whom Maggie had passed as he was sleeping,&mdash;a
rough urchin about the age of Tom. He stared at Maggie, and there ensued much
incomprehensible chattering. She felt very lonely, and was quite sure she
should begin to cry before long; the gypsies didn&rsquo;t seem to mind her at
all, and she felt quite weak among them. But the springing tears were checked
by new terror, when two men came up, whose approach had been the cause of the
sudden excitement. The elder of the two carried a bag, which he flung down,
addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone, which they answered by a
shower of treble sauciness; while a black cur ran barking up to Maggie, and
threw her into a tremor that only found a new cause in the curses with which
the younger man called the dog off, and gave him a rap with a great stick he
held in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these people, or
ever communicate to them amusing and useful knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Both the men now seemed to be inquiring about Maggie, for they looked at her,
and the tone of the conversation became of that pacific kind which implies
curiosity on one side and the power of satisfying it on the other. At last the
younger woman said in her previous deferential, coaxing tone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This nice little lady&rsquo;s come to live with us; aren&rsquo;t you
glad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, very glad,&rdquo; said the younger man, who was looking at
Maggie&rsquo;s silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from
her pocket. He returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman, with
some observation, and she immediately restored them to Maggie&rsquo;s pocket,
while the men seated themselves, and began to attack the contents of the
kettle,&mdash;a stew of meat and potatoes,&mdash;which had been taken off the
fire and turned out into a yellow platter.
</p>

<p>
Maggie began to think that Tom must be right about the gypsies; they must
certainly be thieves, unless the man meant to return her thimble by and by. She
would willingly have given it to him, for she was not at all attached to her
thimble; but the idea that she was among thieves prevented her from feeling any
comfort in the revival of deference and attention toward her; all thieves,
except Robin Hood, were wicked people. The women saw she was frightened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got nothing nice for a lady to eat,&rdquo; said the old
woman, in her coaxing tone. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s so hungry, sweet little
lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, my dear, try if you can eat a bit o&rsquo; this,&rdquo; said the
younger woman, handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to
Maggie, who, remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her for not
liking the bread-and-bacon, dared not refuse the stew, though fear had chased
away her appetite. If her father would but come by in the gig and take her up!
Or even if Jack the Giantkiller, or Mr Greatheart, or St George who slew the
dragon on the half-pennies, would happen to pass that way! But Maggie thought
with a sinking heart that these heroes were never seen in the neighbourhood of
St Ogg&rsquo;s; nothing very wonderful ever came there.
</p>

<p>
Maggie Tulliver, you perceive, was by no means that well trained, well-informed
young person that a small female of eight or nine necessarily is in these days;
she had only been to school a year at St Ogg&rsquo;s, and had so few books
that she sometimes read the dictionary; so that in travelling over her small
mind you would have found the most unexpected ignorance as well as unexpected
knowledge. She could have informed you that there was such a word as
&ldquo;polygamy,&rdquo; and being also acquainted with
&ldquo;polysyllable,&rdquo; she had deduced the conclusion that
&ldquo;poly&rdquo; mean &ldquo;many&rdquo;; but she had had no idea that
gypsies were not well supplied with groceries, and her thoughts generally were
the oddest mixture of clear-eyed acumen and blind dreams.
</p>

<p>
Her ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid modification in the last five
minutes. From having considered them very respectful companions, amenable to
instruction, she had begun to think that they meant perhaps to kill her as soon
as it was dark, and cut up her body for gradual cooking; the suspicion crossed
her that the fierce-eyed old man was in fact the Devil, who might drop that
transparent disguise at any moment, and turn either into the grinning
blacksmith, or else a fiery-eyed monster with dragon&rsquo;s wings. It was no
use trying to eat the stew, and yet the thing she most dreaded was to offend
the gypsies, by betraying her extremely unfavourable opinion of them; and she
wondered, with a keenness of interest that no theologian could have exceeded,
whether, if the Devil were really present, he would know her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t like the smell of it, my dear,&rdquo; said the
young woman, observing that Maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew.
&ldquo;Try a bit, come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Maggie, summoning all her force for a
desperate effort, and trying to smile in a friendly way. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
time, I think; it seems getting darker. I think I must go home now, and come
again another day, and then I can bring you a basket with some jam-tarts and
things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie rose from her seat as she threw out this illusory prospect, devoutly
hoping that Apollyon was gullible; but her hope sank when the old gypsy-woman
said, &ldquo;Stop a bit, stop a bit, little lady; we&rsquo;ll take you home,
all safe, when we&rsquo;ve done supper; you shall ride home, like a
lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie sat down again, with little faith in this promise, though she presently
saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey, and throwing a couple of bags
on his back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then, little missis,&rdquo; said the younger man, rising, and
leading the donkey forward, &ldquo;tell us where you live; what&rsquo;s the
name o&rsquo; the place?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dorlcote Mill is my home,&rdquo; said Maggie, eagerly. &ldquo;My father
is Mr Tulliver; he lives there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! a big mill a little way this side o&rsquo; St Ogg&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;Is it far off? I think I should like to
walk there, if you please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;ll be getting dark, we must make haste. And the
donkey&rsquo;ll carry you as nice as can be; you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He lifted Maggie as he spoke, and set her on the donkey. She felt relieved that
it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her, but she had only a
trembling hope that she was really going home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your pretty bonnet,&rdquo; said the younger woman, putting
that recently despised but now welcome article of costume on Maggie&rsquo;s
head; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll say we&rsquo;ve been very good to you,
won&rsquo;t you? and what a nice little lady we said you was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, thank you,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much
obliged to you. But I wish you&rsquo;d go with me too.&rdquo; She thought
anything was better than going with one of the dreadful men alone; it would be
more cheerful to be murdered by a larger party.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re fondest o&rsquo; <i>me</i>, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
said the woman. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go; you&rsquo;ll go too fast for
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey, holding
Maggie before him, and she was as incapable of remonstrating against this
arrangement as the donkey himself, though no nightmare had ever seemed to her
more horrible. When the woman had patted her on the back, and said
&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; the donkey, at a strong hint from the man&rsquo;s stick,
set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the point Maggie had come from an
hour ago, while the tall girl and the rough urchin, also furnished with sticks,
obligingly escorted them for the first hundred yards, with much screaming and
thwacking.
</p>

<p>
Not Leonore, in that preternatural midnight excursion with her phantom lover,
was more terrified than poor Maggie in this entirely natural ride on a
short-paced donkey, with a gypsy behind her, who considered that he was earning
half a crown. The red light of the setting sun seemed to have a portentous
meaning, with which the alarming bray of the second donkey with the log on its
foot must surely have some connection. Two low thatched cottages&mdash;the only
houses they passed in this lane&mdash;seemed to add to its dreariness; they had
no windows to speak of, and the doors were closed; it was probable that they
were inhabitated by witches, and it was a relief to find that the donkey did
not stop there.
</p>

<p>
At last&mdash;oh, sight of joy!&mdash;this lane, the longest in the world, was
coming to an end, was opening on a broad highroad, where there was actually a
coach passing! And there was a finger-post at the corner,&mdash;she had surely
seen that finger-post before,&mdash;&ldquo;To St Ogg&rsquo;s, 2 miles.&rdquo;
The gypsy really meant to take her home, then; he was probably a good man,
after all, and might have been rather hurt at the thought that she didn&rsquo;t
like coming with him alone. This idea became stronger as she felt more and more
certain that she knew the road quite well, and she was considering how she
might open a conversation with the injured gypsy, and not only gratify his
feelings but efface the impression of her cowardice, when, as they reached a
cross-road. Maggie caught sight of some one coming on a white-faced horse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, stop, stop!&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my father!
Oh, father, father!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sudden joy was almost painful, and before her father reached her, she was
sobbing. Great was Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s wonder, for he had made a round from
Basset, and had not yet been home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the meaning o&rsquo; this?&rdquo; he said, checking
his horse, while Maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her father&rsquo;s
stirrup.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The little miss lost herself, I reckon,&rdquo; said the gypsy.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;d come to our tent at the far end o&rsquo; Dunlow Lane, and I
was bringing her where she said her home was. It&rsquo;s a good way to come
after being on the tramp all day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, father, he&rsquo;s been very good to bring me home,&rdquo; said
Maggie,&mdash;&ldquo;a very kind, good man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, then, my man,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, taking out five shillings.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best day&rsquo;s work <i>you</i> ever did. I
couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose the little wench; here, lift her up before
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Maggie, how&rsquo;s this, how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said, as they
rode along, while she laid her head against her father and sobbed. &ldquo;How
came you to be rambling about and lose yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; sobbed Maggie, &ldquo;I ran away because I was so
unhappy; Tom was so angry with me. I couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, soothingly, &ldquo;you
mustn&rsquo;t think o&rsquo; running away from father. What &rsquo;ud father do
without his little wench?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I never will again, father&mdash;never.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that evening;
and the effect was seen in the remarkable fact that Maggie never heard one
reproach from her mother, or one taunt from Tom, about this foolish business of
her running away to the gypsies. Maggie was rather awe-stricken by this unusual
treatment, and sometimes thought that her conduct had been too wicked to be
alluded to.

Mr and Mrs Glegg at Home</h3>

<p>
In order to see Mr and Mrs Glegg at home, we must enter the town of St
Ogg&rsquo;s,&mdash;that venerable town with the red fluted roofs and the broad
warehouse gables, where the black ships unlade themselves of their burthens
from the far north, and carry away, in exchange, the precious inland products,
the well-crushed cheese and the soft fleeces which my refined readers have
doubtless become acquainted with through the medium of the best classic
pastorals.
</p>

<p>
It is one of those old, old towns which impress one as a continuation and
outgrowth of nature, as much as the nests of the bower-birds or the winding
galleries of the white ants; a town which carries the traces of its long growth
and history like a millennial tree, and has sprung up and developed in the same
spot between the river and the low hill from the time when the Roman legions
turned their backs on it from the camp on the hillside, and the long-haired
sea-kings came up the river and looked with fierce, eager eyes at the fatness
of the land. It is a town &ldquo;familiar with forgotten years.&rdquo; The
shadow of the Saxon hero-king still walks there fitfully, reviewing the scenes
of his youth and love-time, and is met by the gloomier shadow of the dreadful
heathen Dane, who was stabbed in the midst of his warriors by the sword of an
invisible avenger, and who rises on autumn evenings like a white mist from his
tumulus on the hill, and hovers in the court of the old hall by the river-side,
the spot where he was thus miraculously slain in the days before the old hall
was built. It was the Normans who began to build that fine old hall, which is,
like the town, telling of the thoughts and hands of widely sundered
generations; but it is all so old that we look with loving pardon at its
inconsistencies, and are well content that they who built the stone oriel, and
they who built the Gothic façade and towers of finest small brickwork with the
trefoil ornament, and the windows and battlements defined with stone, did not
sacreligiously pull down the ancient half-timbered body with its oak-roofed
banqueting-hall.
</p>

<p>
But older even than this old hall is perhaps the bit of wall now built into the
belfry of the parish church, and said to be a remnant of the original chapel
dedicated to St Ogg, the patron saint of this ancient town, of whose history I
possess several manuscript versions. I incline to the briefest, since, if it
should not be wholly true, it is at least likely to contain the least
falsehood. &ldquo;Ogg the son of Beorl,&rdquo; says my private hagiographer,
&ldquo;was a boatman who gained a scanty living by ferrying passengers across
the river Floss. And it came to pass, one evening when the winds were high,
that there sat moaning by the brink of the river a woman with a child in her
arms; and she was clad in rags, and had a worn and withered look, and she
craved to be rowed across the river. And the men thereabout questioned her, and
said, &lsquo;Wherefore dost thou desire to cross the river? Tarry till the
morning, and take shelter here for the night; so shalt thou be wise and not
foolish.&rsquo; Still she went on to mourn and crave. But Ogg the son of Beorl
came up and said, &lsquo;I will ferry thee across; it is enough that thy heart
needs it.&rsquo; And he ferried her across. And it came to pass, when she
stepped ashore, that her rags were turned into robes of flowing white, and her
face became bright with exceeding beauty, and there was a glory around it, so
that she shed a light on the water like the moon in its brightness. And she
said, &lsquo;Ogg, the son of Beorl, thou art blessed in that thou didst not
question and wrangle with the heart&rsquo;s need, but wast smitten with pity,
and didst straightway relieve the same. And from henceforth whoso steps into
thy boat shall be in no peril from the storm; and whenever it puts forth to the
rescue, it shall save the lives both of men and beasts.&rsquo; And when the
floods came, many were saved by reason of that blessing on the boat. But when
Ogg the son of Beorl died, behold, in the parting of his soul, the boat loosed
itself from its moorings, and was floated with the ebbing tide in great
swiftness to the ocean, and was seen no more. Yet it was witnessed in the
floods of aftertime, that at the coming on of eventide, Ogg the son of Beorl
was always seen with his boat upon the wide-spreading waters, and the Blessed
Virgin sat in the prow, shedding a light around as of the moon in its
brightness, so that the rowers in the gathering darkness took heart and pulled
anew.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This legend, one sees, reflects from a far-off time the visitation of the
floods, which, even when they left human life untouched, were widely fatal to
the helpless cattle, and swept as sudden death over all smaller living things.
But the town knew worse troubles even than the floods,&mdash;troubles of the
civil wars, when it was a continual fighting-place, where first Puritans
thanked God for the blood of the Loyalists, and then Loyalists thanked God for
the blood of the Puritans. Many honest citizens lost all their possessions for
conscience&rsquo; sake in those times, and went forth beggared from their
native town. Doubtless there are many houses standing now on which those honest
citizens turned their backs in sorrow,&mdash;quaint-gabled houses looking on
the river, jammed between newer warehouses, and penetrated by surprising
passages, which turn and turn at sharp angles till they lead you out on a muddy
strand overflowed continually by the rushing tide. Everywhere the brick houses
have a mellow look, and in Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s day there was no incongruous
new-fashioned smartness, no plate-glass in shop-windows, no fresh stucco-facing
or other fallacious attempt to make fine old red St Ogg&rsquo;s wear the air
of a town that sprang up yesterday. The shop-windows were small and
unpretending; for the farmers&rsquo; wives and daughters who came to do their
shopping on market-days were not to be withdrawn from their regular well-known
shops; and the tradesmen had no wares intended for customers who would go on
their way and be seen no more. Ah! even Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s day seems far back
in the past now, separated from us by changes that widen the years. War and the
rumor of war had then died out from the minds of men, and if they were ever
thought of by the farmers in drab greatcoats, who shook the grain out of their
sample-bags and buzzed over it in the full market-place, it was as a state of
things that belonged to a past golden age when prices were high. Surely the
time was gone forever when the broad river could bring up unwelcome ships;
Russia was only the place where the linseed came from,&mdash;the more the
better,&mdash;making grist for the great vertical millstones with their
scythe-like arms, roaring and grinding and carefully sweeping as if an
informing soul were in them. The Catholics, bad harvests, and the mysterious
fluctuations of trade were the three evils mankind had to fear; even the floods
had not been great of late years. The mind of St Ogg&rsquo;s did not look
extensively before or after. It inherited a long past without thinking of it,
and had no eyes for the spirits that walk the streets. Since the centuries when
St Ogg with his boat and the Virgin Mother at the prow had been seen on the
wide water, so many memories had been left behind, and had gradually vanished
like the receding hilltops! And the present time was like the level plain where
men lose their belief in volcanoes and earthquakes, thinking to-morrow will be
as yesterday, and the giant forces that used to shake the earth are forever
laid to sleep. The days were gone when people could be greatly wrought upon by
their faith, still less change it; the Catholics were formidable because they
would lay hold of government and property, and burn men alive; not because any
sane and honest parishioner of St Ogg&rsquo;s could be brought to believe in
the Pope. One aged person remembered how a rude multitude had been swayed when
John Wesley preached in the cattle-market; but for a long while it had not been
expected of preachers that they should shake the souls of men. An occasional
burst of fervor in Dissenting pulpits on the subject of infant baptism was the
only symptom of a zeal unsuited to sober times when men had done with change.
Protestantism sat at ease, unmindful of schisms, careless of proselytism:
Dissent was an inheritance along with a superior pew and a business connection;
and Churchmanship only wondered contemptuously at Dissent as a foolish habit
that clung greatly to families in the grocery and chandlering lines, though not
incompatible with prosperous wholesale dealing. But with the Catholic Question
had come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm: the elderly rector had
become occasionally historical and argumentative; and Mr Spray, the
Independent minister, had begun to preach political sermons, in which he
distinguished with much subtlety between his fervent belief in the right of the
Catholics to the franchise and his fervent belief in their eternal perdition.
Most of Mr Spray&rsquo;s hearers, however, were incapable of following his
subtleties, and many old-fashioned Dissenters were much pained by his
&ldquo;siding with the Catholics&rdquo;; while others thought he had better let
politics alone. Public spirit was not held in high esteem at St Ogg&rsquo;s,
and men who busied themselves with political questions were regarded with some
suspicion, as dangerous characters; they were usually persons who had little or
no business of their own to manage, or, if they had, were likely enough to
become insolvent.
</p>

<p>
This was the general aspect of things at St Ogg&rsquo;s in Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s
day, and at that particular period in her family history when she had had her
quarrel with Mr Tulliver. It was a time when ignorance was much more
comfortable than at present, and was received with all the honours in very good
society, without being obliged to dress itself in an elaborate costume of
knowledge; a time when cheap periodicals were not, and when country surgeons
never thought of asking their female patients if they were fond of reading, but
simply took it for granted that they preferred gossip; a time when ladies in
rich silk gowns wore large pockets, in which they carried a mutton-bone to
secure them against cramp. Mrs Glegg carried such a bone, which she had
inherited from her grandmother with a brocaded gown that would stand up empty,
like a suit of armor, and a silver-headed walking-stick; for the Dodson family
had been respectable for many generations.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg had both a front and a back parlour in her excellent house at St
Ogg&rsquo;s, so that she had two points of view from which she could observe
the weakness of her fellow-beings, and reinforce her thankfulness for her own
exceptional strength of mind. From her front window she could look down the
Tofton Road, leading out of St Ogg&rsquo;s, and note the growing tendency to
&ldquo;gadding about&rdquo; in the wives of men not retired from business,
together with a practice of wearing woven cotton stockings, which opened a
dreary prospect for the coming generation; and from her back windows she could
look down the pleasant garden and orchard which stretched to the river, and
observe the folly of Mr Glegg in spending his time among &ldquo;them flowers
and vegetables.&rdquo; For Mr Glegg, having retired from active business as a
wool-stapler for the purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his life,
had found this last occupation so much more severe than his business, that he
had been driven into amateur hard labour as a dissipation, and habitually
relaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners. The economizing of a
gardener&rsquo;s wages might perhaps have induced Mrs Glegg to wink at this
folly, if it were possible for a healthy female mind even to simulate respect
for a husband&rsquo;s hobby. But it is well known that this conjugal
complacency belongs only to the weaker portion of the sex, who are scarcely
alive to the responsibilities of a wife as a constituted check on her
husband&rsquo;s pleasures, which are hardly ever of a rational or commendable
kind.
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg on his side, too, had a double source of mental occupation, which
gave every promise of being inexhaustible. On the one hand, he surprised
himself by his discoveries in natural history, finding that his piece of
garden-ground contained wonderful caterpillars, slugs, and insects, which, so
far as he had heard, had never before attracted human observation; and he
noticed remarkable coincidences between these zoological phenomena and the
great events of that time,&mdash;as, for example, that before the burning of
York Minster there had been mysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the
rose-trees, together with an unusual prevalence of slugs, which he had been
puzzled to know the meaning of, until it flashed upon him with this melancholy
conflagration. (Mr Glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity, which, when
disengaged from the wool business, naturally made itself a pathway in other
directions.) And his second subject of meditation was the
&ldquo;contrairiness&rdquo; of the female mind, as typically exhibited in Mrs
Glegg. That a creature made&mdash;in a genealogical sense&mdash;out of a
man&rsquo;s rib, and in this particular case maintained in the highest
respectability without any trouble of her own, should be normally in a state of
contradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the most accommodating
concessions, was a mystery in the scheme of things to which he had often in
vain sought a clew in the early chapters of Genesis. Mr Glegg had chosen the
eldest Miss Dodson as a handsome embodiment of female prudence and thrift, and
being himself of a money-getting, money-keeping turn, had calculated on much
conjugal harmony. But in that curious compound, the feminine character, it may
easily happen that the flavour is unpleasant in spite of excellent ingredients;
and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with a seasoning that quite
spoils its relish. Now, good Mr Glegg himself was stingy in the most amiable
manner; his neighbours called him &ldquo;near,&rdquo; which always means that
the person in question is a lovable skinflint. If you expressed a preference
for cheese-parings, Mr Glegg would remember to save them for you, with a
good-natured delight in gratifying your palate, and he was given to pet all
animals which required no appreciable keep. There was no humbug or hypocrisy
about Mr Glegg; his eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale of
a widow&rsquo;s furniture, which a five-pound note from his side pocket would
have prevented; but a donation of five pounds to a person &ldquo;in a small way
of life&rdquo; would have seemed to him a mad kind of lavishness rather than
&ldquo;charity,&rdquo; which had always presented itself to him as a
contribution of small aids, not a neutralizing of misfortune. And Mr Glegg was
just as fond of saving other people&rsquo;s money as his own; he would have
ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his expenses were to be paid for
him, as when they were to come out of his own pocket, and was quite zealous in
trying to induce indifferent acquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for
blacking. This inalienable habit of saving, as an end in itself, belonged to
the industrious men of business of a former generation, who made their fortunes
slowly, almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the harrier,&mdash;it
constituted them a &ldquo;race,&rdquo; which is nearly lost in these days of
rapid money-getting, when lavishness comes close on the back of want. In
old-fashioned times an &ldquo;independence&rdquo; was hardly ever made without
a little miserliness as a condition, and you would have found that quality in
every provincial district, combined with characters as various as the fruits
from which we can extract acid. The true Harpagons were always marked and
exceptional characters; not so the worthy tax-payers, who, having once pinched
from real necessity, retained even in the midst of their comfortable
retirement, with their wallfruit and wine-bins, the habit of regarding life as
an ingenious process of nibbling out one&rsquo;s livelihood without leaving any
perceptible deficit, and who would have been as immediately prompted to give up
a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred a year, as when
they had only five hundred pounds of capital. Mr Glegg was one of these men,
found so impracticable by chancellors of the exchequer; and knowing this, you
will be the better able to understand why he had not swerved from the
conviction that he had made an eligible marriage, in spite of the too pungent
seasoning that nature had given to the eldest Miss Dodson&rsquo;s virtues. A
man with an affectionate disposition, who finds a wife to concur with his
fundamental idea of life, easily comes to persuade himself that no other woman
would have suited him so well, and does a little daily snapping and quarrelling
without any sense of alienation. Mr Glegg, being of a reflective turn, and no
longer occupied with wool, had much wondering meditation on the peculiar
constitution of the female mind as unfolded to him in his domestic life; and
yet he thought Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s household ways a model for her sex. It struck
him as a pitiable irregularity in other women if they did not roll up their
table-napkins with the same tightness and emphasis as Mrs Glegg did, if their
pastry had a less leathery consistence, and their damson cheese a less
venerable hardness than hers; nay, even the peculiar combination of grocery and
druglike odors in Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s private cupboard impressed him as the only
right thing in the way of cupboard smells. I am not sure that he would not have
longed for the quarrelling again, if it had ceased for an entire week; and it
is certain that an acquiescent, mild wife would have left his meditations
comparatively jejune and barren of mystery.
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg&rsquo;s unmistakable kind-heartedness was shown in this, that it
pained him more to see his wife at variance with others,&mdash;even with Dolly,
the servant,&mdash;than to be in a state of cavil with her himself; and the
quarrel between her and Mr Tulliver vexed him so much that it quite nullified
the pleasure he would otherwise have had in the state of his early cabbages, as
he walked in his garden before breakfast the next morning. Still, he went in to
breakfast with some slight hope that, now Mrs Glegg had &ldquo;slept upon
it,&rdquo; her anger might be subdued enough to give way to her usually strong
sense of family decorum. She had been used to boast that there had never been
any of those deadly quarrels among the Dodsons which had disgraced other
families; that no Dodson had ever been &ldquo;cut off with a shilling,&rdquo;
and no cousin of the Dodsons disowned; as, indeed, why should they be? For they
had no cousins who had not money out at use, or some houses of their own, at
the very least.
</p>

<p>
There was one evening-cloud which had always disappeared from Mrs
Glegg&rsquo;s brow when she sat at the breakfast-table. It was her fuzzy front
of curls; for as she occupied herself in household matters in the morning it
would have been a mere extravagance to put on anything so superfluous to the
making of leathery pastry as a fuzzy curled front. By half-past ten decorum
demanded the front; until then Mrs Glegg could economise it, and society would
never be any the wiser. But the absence of that cloud only left it more
apparent that the cloud of severity remained; and Mr Glegg, perceiving this,
as he sat down to his milkporridge, which it was his old frugal habit to stem
his morning hunger with, prudently resolved to leave the first remark to Mrs
Glegg, lest, to so delicate an article as a lady&rsquo;s temper, the slightest
touch should do mischief. People who seem to enjoy their ill temper have a way
of keeping it in fine condition by inflicting privations on themselves. That
was Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s way. She made her tea weaker than usual this morning,
and declined butter. It was a hard case that a vigorous mood for quarrelling,
so highly capable of using an opportunity, should not meet with a single remark
from Mr Glegg on which to exercise itself. But by and by it appeared that his
silence would answer the purpose, for he heard himself apostrophised at last in
that tone peculiar to the wife of one&rsquo;s bosom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr Glegg! it&rsquo;s a poor return I get for making you the wife
I&rsquo;ve made you all these years. If this is the way I&rsquo;m to be
treated, I&rsquo;d better ha&rsquo; known it before my poor father died, and
then, when I&rsquo;d wanted a home, I should ha&rsquo; gone elsewhere, as the
choice was offered me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg paused from his porridge and looked up, not with any new amazement,
but simply with that quiet, habitual wonder with which we regard constant
mysteries.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Mrs G., what have I done now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Done now, Mr Glegg? <i>done now?</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Not seeing his way to any pertinent answer, Mr Glegg reverted to his porridge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s husbands in the world,&rdquo; continued Mrs Glegg, after
a pause, &ldquo;as &rsquo;ud have known how to do something different to siding
with everybody else against their own wives. Perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong and you
can teach me better. But I&rsquo;ve allays heard as it&rsquo;s the
husband&rsquo;s place to stand by the wife, instead o&rsquo; rejoicing and
triumphing when folks insult her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, what call have you to say that?&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, rather
warmly, for though a kind man, he was not as meek as Moses. &ldquo;When did I
rejoice or triumph over you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s ways o&rsquo; doing things worse than speaking out plain,
Mr Glegg. I&rsquo;d sooner you&rsquo;d tell me to my face as you make light of
me, than try to make out as everybody&rsquo;s in the right but me, and come to
your breakfast in the morning, as I&rsquo;ve hardly slept an hour this night,
and sulk at me as if I was the dirt under your feet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sulk at you?&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, in a tone of angry facetiousness.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like a tipsy man as thinks everybody&rsquo;s had too much
but himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lower yourself with using coarse language to <i>me</i>, Mr
Glegg! It makes you look very small, though you can&rsquo;t see
yourself,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, in a tone of energetic compassion. &ldquo;A
man in your place should set an example, and talk more sensible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but will you listen to sense?&rdquo; retorted Mr Glegg, sharply.
&ldquo;The best sense I can talk to you is what I said last night,&mdash;as
you&rsquo;re i&rsquo; the wrong to think o&rsquo; calling in your money, when
it&rsquo;s safe enough if you&rsquo;d let it alone, all because of a bit of a
tiff, and I was in hopes you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; altered your mind this morning.
But if you&rsquo;d like to call it in, don&rsquo;t do it in a hurry now, and
breed more enmity in the family, but wait till there&rsquo;s a pretty mortgage
to be had without any trouble. You&rsquo;d have to set the lawyer to work now
to find an investment, and make no end o&rsquo; expense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg felt there was really something in this, but she tossed her head and
emitted a guttural interjection to indicate that her silence was only an
armistice, not a peace. And, in fact hostilities soon broke out again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you for my cup o&rsquo; tea, now, Mrs G.,&rdquo; said
Mr Glegg, seeing that she did not proceed to give it him as usual, when he had
finished his porridge. She lifted the teapot with a slight toss of the head,
and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;ll <i>thank</i> me, Mr Glegg.
It&rsquo;s little thanks <i>I</i> get for what I do for folks i&rsquo; this
world. Though there&rsquo;s never a woman o&rsquo; <i>your</i> side o&rsquo;
the family, Mr Glegg, as is fit to stand up with me, and I&rsquo;d say it if I
was on my dying bed. Not but what I&rsquo;ve allays conducted myself civil to
your kin, and there isn&rsquo;t one of &rsquo;em can say the contrary, though
my equils they aren&rsquo;t, and nobody shall make me say it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better leave finding fault wi&rsquo; my kin till
you&rsquo;ve left off quarrelling with you own, Mrs G.,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg,
with angry sarcasm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you for the milk-jug.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as false a word as ever you spoke, Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said
the lady, pouring out the milk with unusual profuseness, as much as to say, if
he wanted milk he should have it with a vengeance. &ldquo;And you know
it&rsquo;s false. I&rsquo;m not the woman to quarrel with my own kin;
<i>you</i> may, for I&rsquo;ve known you to do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister&rsquo;s
house in a tantrum?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no quarrel wi&rsquo; my sister, Mr Glegg, and it&rsquo;s
false to say it. Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; my blood, and it was him
quarrelled with me, and drove me out o&rsquo; the house. But perhaps
you&rsquo;d have had me stay and be swore at, Mr Glegg; perhaps you was vexed
not to hear more abuse and foul language poured out upo&rsquo; your own wife.
But, let me tell you, it&rsquo;s <i>your</i> disgrace.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did ever anybody hear the like i&rsquo; this parish?&rdquo; said Mr
Glegg, getting hot. &ldquo;A woman, with everything provided for her, and
allowed to keep her own money the same as if it was settled on her, and with a
gig new stuffed and lined at no end o&rsquo; expense, and provided for when I
die beyond anything she could expect&mdash;to go on i&rsquo; this way, biting
and snapping like a mad dog! It&rsquo;s beyond everything, as God A
&rsquo;mighty should ha&rsquo; made women <i>so</i>.&rdquo; (These last words
were uttered in a tone of sorrowful agitation. Mr Glegg pushed his tea from
him, and tapped the table with both his hands.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr Glegg, if those are your feelings, it&rsquo;s best they should
be known,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, taking off her napkin, and folding it in an
excited manner. &ldquo;But if you talk o&rsquo; my being provided for beyond
what I could expect, I beg leave to tell you as I&rsquo;d a right to expect a
many things as I don&rsquo;t find. And as to my being like a mad dog,
it&rsquo;s well if you&rsquo;re not cried shame on by the county for your
treatment of me, for it&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t bear, and I won&rsquo;t
bear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s voice intimated that she was going to cry, and breaking
off from speech, she rang the bell violently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sally,&rdquo; she said, rising from her chair, and speaking in rather a
choked voice, &ldquo;light a fire up-stairs, and put the blinds down. Mr
Glegg, you&rsquo;ll please to order what you&rsquo;d like for dinner. I shall
have gruel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg walked across the room to the small book-case, and took down
Baxter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Saints&rsquo; Everlasting Rest,&rdquo; which she carried
with her up-stairs. It was the book she was accustomed to lay open before her
on special occasions,&mdash;on wet Sunday mornings, or when she heard of a
death in the family, or when, as in this case, her quarrel with Mr Glegg had
been set an octave higher than usual.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs Glegg carried something else up-stairs with her, which, together with
the &ldquo;Saints&rsquo; Rest&rdquo; and the gruel, may have had some influence
in gradually calming her feelings, and making it possible for her to endure
existence on the ground-floor, shortly before tea-time. This was, partly, Mr
Glegg&rsquo;s suggestion that she would do well to let her five hundred lie
still until a good investment turned up; and, further, his parenthetic hint at
his handsome provision for her in case of his death. Mr Glegg, like all men of
his stamp, was extremely reticent about his will; and Mrs Glegg, in her
gloomier moments, had forebodings that, like other husbands of whom she had
heard, he might cherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death
by leaving her poorly off, in which case she was firmly resolved that she would
have scarcely any weeper on her bonnet, and would cry no more than if he had
been a second husband. But if he had really shown her any testamentary
tenderness, it would be affecting to think of him, poor man, when he was gone;
and even his foolish fuss about the flowers and garden-stuff, and his
insistence on the subject of snails, would be touching when it was once fairly
at an end. To survive Mr Glegg, and talk eulogistically of him as a man who
might have his weaknesses, but who had done the right thing by her,
not-withstanding his numerous poor relations; to have sums of interest coming
in more frequently, and secrete it in various corners, baffling to the most
ingenious of thieves (for, to Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s mind, banks and strong-boxes
would have nullified the pleasure of property; she might as well have taken her
food in capsules); finally, to be looked up to by her own family and the
neighbourhood, so as no woman can ever hope to be who has not the præterite and
present dignity comprised in being a &ldquo;widow well left,&rdquo;&mdash;all
this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future. So that when good
Mr Glegg, restored to good humour by much hoeing, and moved by the sight of his
wife&rsquo;s empty chair, with her knitting rolled up in the corner, went
up-stairs to her, and observed that the bell had been tolling for poor Mr
Morton, Mrs Glegg answered magnanimously, quite as if she had been an uninjured
woman: &ldquo;Ah! then, there&rsquo;ll be a good business for somebody to take
to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Baxter had been open at least eight hours by this time, for it was nearly five
o&rsquo;clock; and if people are to quarrel often, it follows as a corollary
that their quarrels cannot be protracted beyond certain limits.
</p>

<p>
Mr and Mrs Glegg talked quite amicably about the Tullivers that evening. Mr
Glegg went the length of admitting that Tulliver was a sad man for getting into
hot water, and was like enough to run through his property; and Mrs Glegg,
meeting this acknowledgment half-way, declared that it was beneath her to take
notice of such a man&rsquo;s conduct, and that, for her sister&rsquo;s sake,
she would let him keep the five hundred a while longer, for when she put it out
on a mortgage she should only get four per cent.

Mr Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life</h3>

<p>
Owing to this new adjustment of Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s thoughts, Mrs Pullet found
her task of mediation the next day surprisingly easy. Mrs Glegg, indeed
checked her rather sharply for thinking it would be necessary to tell her elder
sister what was the right mode of behaviour in family matters. Mrs
Pullet&rsquo;s argument, that it would look ill in the neighbourhood if people
should have it in their power to say that there was a quarrel in the family,
was particularly offensive. If the family name never suffered except through
Mrs Glegg, Mrs Pullet might lay her head on her pillow in perfect confidence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to be expected, I suppose,&rdquo; observed Mrs Glegg, by
way of winding up the subject, &ldquo;as I shall go to the mill again before
Bessy comes to see me, or as I shall go and fall down o&rsquo; my knees to Mr
Tulliver, and ask his pardon for showing him favours; but I shall bear no
malice, and when Mr Tulliver speaks civil to me, I&rsquo;ll speak civil to
him. Nobody has any call to tell me what&rsquo;s becoming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Finding it unnecessary to plead for the Tullivers, it was natural that aunt
Pullet should relax a little in her anxiety for them, and recur to the
annoyance she had suffered yesterday from the offspring of that apparently
ill-fated house. Mrs Glegg heard a circumstantial narrative, to which Mr
Pullet&rsquo;s remarkable memory furnished some items; and while aunt Pullet
pitied poor Bessy&rsquo;s bad luck with her children, and expressed a
half-formed project of paying for Maggie&rsquo;s being sent to a distant
boarding-school, which would not prevent her being so brown, but might tend to
subdue some other vices in her, aunt Glegg blamed Bessy for her weakness, and
appealed to all witnesses who should be living when the Tulliver children had
turned out ill, that she, Mrs Glegg, had always said how it would be from the
very first, observing that it was wonderful to herself how all her words came
true.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I may call and tell Bessy you&rsquo;ll bear no malice, and
everything be as it was before?&rdquo; Mrs Pullet said, just before parting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you may, Sophy,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg; &ldquo;you may tell Mr
Tulliver, and Bessy too, as I&rsquo;m not going to behave ill because folks
behave ill to me; I know it&rsquo;s my place, as the eldest, to set an example
in every respect, and I do it. Nobody can say different of me, if they&rsquo;ll
keep to the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg being in this state of satisfaction in her own lofty magnanimity, I
leave you to judge what effect was produced on her by the reception of a short
letter from Mr Tulliver that very evening, after Mrs Pullet&rsquo;s
departure, informing her that she needn&rsquo;t trouble her mind about her five
hundred pounds, for it should be paid back to her in the course of the next
month at farthest, together with the interest due thereon until the time of
payment. And furthermore, that Mr Tulliver had no wish to behave uncivilly to
Mrs Glegg, and she was welcome to his house whenever she liked to come, but he
desired no favours from her, either for himself or his children.
</p>

<p>
It was poor Mrs Tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe, entirely through
that irrepressible hopefulness of hers which led her to expect that similar
causes may at any time produce different results. It had very often occurred in
her experience that Mr Tulliver had done something because other people had
said he was not able to do it, or had pitied him for his supposed inability, or
in any other way piqued his pride; still, she thought to-day, if she told him
when he came in to tea that sister Pullet was gone to try and make everything
up with sister Glegg, so that he needn&rsquo;t think about paying in the money,
it would give a cheerful effect to the meal. Mr Tulliver had never slackened
in his resolve to raise the money, but now he at once determined to write a
letter to Mrs Glegg, which should cut off all possibility of mistake. Mrs
Pullet gone to beg and pray for <i>him</i> indeed! Mr Tulliver did not
willingly write a letter, and found the relation between spoken and written
language, briefly known as spelling, one of the most puzzling things in this
puzzling world. Nevertheless, like all fervid writing, the task was done in
less time than usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs
Glegg&rsquo;s,&mdash;why, she belonged, like himself, to a generation with whom
spelling was a matter of private judgment.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg did not alter her will in consequence of this letter, and cut off
the Tulliver children from their sixth and seventh share in her thousand
pounds; for she had her principles. No one must be able to say of her when she
was dead that she had not divided her money with perfect fairness among her own
kin. In the matter of wills, personal qualities were subordinate to the great
fundamental fact of blood; and to be determined in the distribution of your
property by caprice, and not make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees
of kinship, was a prospective disgrace that would have embittered her life.
This had always been a principle in the Dodson family; it was one form of that
sense of honour and rectitude which was a proud tradition in such
families,&mdash;a tradition which has been the salt of our provincial society.
</p>

<p>
But though the letter could not shake Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s principles, it made
the family breach much more difficult to mend; and as to the effect it produced
on Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s opinion of Mr Tulliver, she begged to be understood from
that time forth that she had nothing whatever to say about him; his state of
mind, apparently, was too corrupt for her to contemplate it for a moment. It
was not until the evening before Tom went to school, at the beginning of
August, that Mrs Glegg paid a visit to her sister Tulliver, sitting in her gig
all the while, and showing her displeasure by markedly abstaining from all
advice and criticism; for, as she observed to her sister Deane, &ldquo;Bessy
must bear the consequence o&rsquo; having such a husband, though I&rsquo;m
sorry for her,&rdquo; and Mrs Deane agreed that Bessy was pitiable.
</p>

<p>
That evening Tom observed to Maggie: &ldquo;Oh my! Maggie, aunt Glegg&rsquo;s
beginning to come again; I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m going to school.
<i>You&rsquo;ll</i> catch it all now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of Tom&rsquo;s going away
from her, that this playful exultation of his seemed very unkind, and she cried
herself to sleep that night.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in
finding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred pounds
on bond. &ldquo;It must be no client of Wakem&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said to
himself; and yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary; not
because Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s will was feeble, but because external fact was
stronger. Wakem&rsquo;s client was the only convenient person to be found. Mr
Tulliver had a destiny as well as Œdipus, and in this case he might plead, like
Œdipus, that his deed was inflicted on him rather than committed by him.

Tom&rsquo;s &ldquo;First Half&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Tom Tulliver&rsquo;s sufferings during the first quarter he was at King&rsquo;s
Lorton, under the distinguished care of the Rev. Walter Stelling, were rather
severe. At Mr Jacob&rsquo;s academy life had not presented itself to him as a
difficult problem; there were plenty of fellows to play with, and Tom being
good at all active games,&mdash;fighting especially,&mdash;had that precedence
among them which appeared to him inseparable from the personality of Tom
Tulliver. Mr Jacobs himself, familiarly known as Old Goggles, from his habit
of wearing spectacles, imposed no painful awe; and if it was the property of
snuffy old hypocrites like him to write like copperplate and surround their
signatures with arabesques, to spell without forethought, and to spout
&ldquo;my name is Norval&rdquo; without bungling, Tom, for his part, was glad
he was not in danger of those mean accomplishments. He was not going to be a
snuffy schoolmaster, he, but a substantial man, like his father, who used to go
hunting when he was younger, and rode a capital black mare,&mdash;as pretty a
bit of horse-flesh as ever you saw; Tom had heard what her points were a
hundred times. <i>He</i> meant to go hunting too, and to be generally
respected. When people were grown up, he considered, nobody inquired about
their writing and spelling; when he was a man, he should be master of
everything, and do just as he liked. It had been very difficult for him to
reconcile himself to the idea that his school-time was to be prolonged and that
he was not to be brought up to his father&rsquo;s business, which he had always
thought extremely pleasant; for it was nothing but riding about, giving orders,
and going to market; and he thought that a clergyman would give him a great
many Scripture lessons, and probably make him learn the Gospel and Epistle on a
Sunday, as well as the Collect. But in the absence of specific information, it
was impossible for him to imagine that school and a schoolmaster would be
something entirely different from the academy of Mr Jacobs. So, not to be at a
deficiency, in case of his finding genial companions, he had taken care to
carry with him a small box of percussion-caps; not that there was anything
particular to be done with them, but they would serve to impress strange boys
with a sense of his familiarity with guns. Thus poor Tom, though he saw very
clearly through Maggie&rsquo;s illusions, was not without illusions of his own,
which were to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience at King&rsquo;s
Lorton.
</p>

<p>
He had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that life,
complicated not only with the Latin grammar but with a new standard of English
pronunciation, was a very difficult business, made all the more obscure by a
thick mist of bashfulness. Tom, as you have observed, was never an exception
among boys for ease of address; but the difficulty of enunciating a
monosyllable in reply to Mr or Mrs Stelling was so great, that he even
dreaded to be asked at table whether he would have more pudding. As to the
percussion-caps, he had almost resolved, in the bitterness of his heart, that
he would throw them into a neighbouring pond; for not only was he the solitary
pupil, but he began even to have a certain scepticism about guns, and a general
sense that his theory of life was undermined. For Mr Stelling thought nothing
of guns, or horses either, apparently; and yet it was impossible for Tom to
despise Mr Stelling as he had despised Old Goggles. If there were anything
that was not thoroughly genuine about Mr Stelling, it lay quite beyond
Tom&rsquo;s power to detect it; it is only by a wide comparison of facts that
the wisest full-grown man can distinguish well-rolled barrels from mere
supernal thunder.
</p>

<p>
Mr Stelling was a well-sized, broad-chested man, not yet thirty, with flaxen
hair standing erect, and large lightish-gray eyes, which were always very wide
open; he had a sonorous bass voice, and an air of defiant self-confidence
inclining to brazenness. He had entered on his career with great vigor, and
intended to make a considerable impression on his fellowmen. The Rev. Walter
Stelling was not a man who would remain among the &ldquo;inferior clergy&rdquo;
all his life. He had a true British determination to push his way in the
world,&mdash;as a schoolmaster, in the first place, for there were capital
masterships of grammar-schools to be had, and Mr Stelling meant to have one of
them; but as a preacher also, for he meant always to preach in a striking
manner, so as to have his congregation swelled by admirers from neighbouring
parishes, and to produce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for
a brother clergyman of minor gifts. The style of preaching he had chosen was
the extemporaneous, which was held little short of the miraculous in rural
parishes like King&rsquo;s Lorton. Some passages of Massillon and Bourdaloue,
which he knew by heart, were really very effective when rolled out in Mr
Stelling&rsquo;s deepest tones; but as comparatively feeble appeals of his own
were delivered in the same loud and impressive manner, they were often thought
quite as striking by his hearers. Mr Stelling&rsquo;s doctrine was of no
particular school; if anything, it had a tinge of evangelicalism, for that was
&ldquo;the telling thing&rdquo; just then in the diocese to which King&rsquo;s
Lorton belonged. In short, Mr Stelling was a man who meant to rise in his
profession, and to rise by merit, clearly, since he had no interest beyond what
might be promised by a problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not
yet become Lord Chancellor. A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions
naturally gets a little into debt at starting; it is not to be expected that he
will live in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate all his
life; and if the few hundreds Mr Timpson advanced toward his daughter&rsquo;s
fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture, together with a
stock of wine, a grand piano, and the laying out of a superior flower-garden,
it followed in the most rigorous manner, either that these things must be
procured by some other means, or else that the Rev. Mr Stelling must go
without them, which last alternative would be an absurd procrastination of the
fruits of success, where success was certain. Mr Stelling was so broad-chested
and resolute that he felt equal to anything; he would become celebrated by
shaking the consciences of his hearers, and he would by and by edit a Greek
play, and invent several new readings. He had not yet selected the play, for
having been married little more than two years, his leisure time had been much
occupied with attentions to Mrs Stelling; but he had told that fine woman what
he meant to do some day, and she felt great confidence in her husband, as a man
who understood everything of that sort.
</p>

<p>
But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver during
this first half-year; for, by a singular coincidence, there had been some
negotiation concerning another pupil from the same neighbourhood and it might
further a decision in Mr Stelling&rsquo;s favour, if it were understood that
young Tulliver, who, Mr Stelling observed in conjugal privacy, was rather a
rough cub, had made prodigious progress in a short time. It was on this ground
that he was severe with Tom about his lessons; he was clearly a boy whose
powers would never be developed through the medium of the Latin grammar,
without the application of some sternness. Not that Mr Stelling was a
harsh-tempered or unkind man; quite the contrary. He was jocose with Tom at
table, and corrected his provincialisms and his deportment in the most playful
manner; but poor Tom was only the more cowed and confused by this double
novelty, for he had never been used to jokes at all like Mr Stelling&rsquo;s;
and for the first time in his life he had a painful sense that he was all wrong
somehow. When Mr Stelling said, as the roast-beef was being uncovered,
&ldquo;Now, Tulliver! which would you rather decline, roast-beef or the Latin
for it?&rdquo; Tom, to whom in his coolest moments a pun would have been a hard
nut, was thrown into a state of embarrassed alarm that made everything dim to
him except the feeling that he would rather not have anything to do with Latin;
of course he answered, &ldquo;Roast-beef,&rdquo; whereupon there followed much
laughter and some practical joking with the plates, from which Tom gathered
that he had in some mysterious way refused beef, and, in fact, made himself
appear &ldquo;a silly.&rdquo; If he could have seen a fellow-pupil undergo
these painful operations and survive them in good spirits, he might sooner have
taken them as a matter of course. But there are two expensive forms of
education, either of which a parent may procure for his son by sending him as
solitary pupil to a clergyman: one is the enjoyment of the reverend
gentleman&rsquo;s undivided neglect; the other is the endurance of the reverend
gentleman&rsquo;s undivided attention. It was the latter privilege for which
Mr Tulliver paid a high price in Tom&rsquo;s initiatory months at King&rsquo;s
Lorton.
</p>

<p>
That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind, and driven homeward
in a state of great mental satisfaction. He considered that it was a happy
moment for him when he had thought of asking Riley&rsquo;s advice about a tutor
for Tom. Mr Stelling&rsquo;s eyes were so wide open, and he talked in such an
off-hand, matter-of-fact way, answering every difficult, slow remark of Mr
Tulliver&rsquo;s with, &ldquo;I see, my good sir, I see&rdquo;; &ldquo;To be
sure, to be sure&rdquo;; &ldquo;You want your son to be a man who will make his
way in the world,&rdquo;&mdash;that Mr Tulliver was delighted to find in him a
clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the everyday affairs of this
life. Except Counsellor Wylde, whom he had heard at the last sessions, Mr
Tulliver thought the Rev. Mr Stelling was the shrewdest fellow he had ever met
with,&mdash;not unlike Wylde, in fact; he had the same way of sticking his
thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat. Mr Tulliver was not by any means an
exception in mistaking brazenness for shrewdness; most laymen thought Stelling
shrewd, and a man of remarkable powers generally; it was chiefly by his
clerical brethren that he was considered rather a dull fellow. But he told Mr
Tulliver several stories about &ldquo;Swing&rdquo; and incendiarism, and asked
his advice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious a manner,
with so much polished glibness of tongue, that the miller thought, here was the
very thing he wanted for Tom. He had no doubt this first-rate man was
acquainted with every branch of information, and knew exactly what Tom must
learn in order to become a match for the lawyers, which poor Mr Tulliver
himself did <i>not</i> know, and so was necessarily thrown for self-direction
on this wide kind of inference. It is hardly fair to laugh at him, for I have
known much more highly instructed persons than he make inferences quite as
wide, and not at all wiser.
</p>

<p>
As for Mrs Tulliver, finding that Mrs Stelling&rsquo;s views as to the airing
of linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy entirely
coincided with her own; moreover, that Mrs Stelling, though so young a woman,
and only anticipating her second confinement, had gone through very nearly the
same experience as herself with regard to the behaviour and fundamental
character of the monthly nurse,&mdash;she expressed great contentment to her
husband, when they drove away, at leaving Tom with a woman who, in spite of her
youth, seemed quite sensible and motherly, and asked advice as prettily as
could be.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They must be very well off, though,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver,
&ldquo;for everything&rsquo;s as nice as can be all over the house, and that
watered silk she had on cost a pretty penny. Sister Pullet has got one like
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got some income besides
the curacy, I reckon. Perhaps her father allows &rsquo;em something.
There&rsquo;s Tom &rsquo;ull be another hundred to him, and not much trouble
either, by his own account; he says teaching comes natural to him. That&rsquo;s
wonderful, now,&rdquo; added Mr Tulliver, turning his head on one side, and
giving his horse a meditative tickling on the flank.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to Mr Stelling, that he set
about it with that uniformity of method and independence of circumstances which
distinguish the actions of animals understood to be under the immediate
teaching of nature. Mr Broderip&rsquo;s amiable beaver, as that charming
naturalist tells us, busied himself as earnestly in constructing a dam, in a
room up three pair of stairs in London, as if he had been laying his foundation
in a stream or lake in Upper Canada. It was &ldquo;Binny&rsquo;s&rdquo;
function to build; the absence of water or of possible progeny was an accident
for which he was not accountable. With the same unerring instinct Mr Stelling
set to work at his natural method of instilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid
into the mind of Tom Tulliver. This, he considered, was the only basis of solid
instruction; all other means of education were mere charlatanism, and could
produce nothing better than smatterers. Fixed on this firm basis, a man might
observe the display of various or special knowledge made by irregularly
educated people with a pitying smile; all that sort of thing was very well, but
it was impossible these people could form sound opinions. In holding this
conviction Mr Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors have been, by the
excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship; and as to his views about
Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from personal partiality. Mr Stelling
was very far from being led astray by enthusiasm, either religious or
intellectual; on the other hand, he had no secret belief that everything was
humbug. He thought religion was a very excellent thing, and Aristotle a great
authority, and deaneries and prebends useful institutions, and Great Britain
the providential bulwark of Protestantism, and faith in the unseen a great
support to afflicted minds; he believed in all these things, as a Swiss
hotel-keeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him, and in the
pleasure it gives to artistic visitors. And in the same way Mr Stelling
believed in his method of education; he had no doubt that he was doing the very
best thing for Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s boy. Of course, when the miller talked of
&ldquo;mapping&rdquo; and &ldquo;summing&rdquo; in a vague and diffident
manner, Mr Stelling had set his mind at rest by an assurance that he understood
what was wanted; for how was it possible the good man could form any reasonable
judgment about the matter? Mr Stelling&rsquo;s duty was to teach the lad in the
only right way,&mdash;indeed he knew no other; he had not wasted his time in
the acquirement of anything abnormal.
</p>

<p>
He very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad; for though by hard
labour he could get particular declensions into his brain, anything so abstract
as the relation between cases and terminations could by no means get such a
lodgment there as to enable him to recognise a chance genitive or dative. This
struck Mr Stelling as something more than natural stupidity; he suspected
obstinacy, or at any rate indifference, and lectured Tom severely on his want
of thorough application. &ldquo;You feel no interest in what you&rsquo;re
doing, sir,&rdquo; Mr Stelling would say, and the reproach was painfully true.
Tom had never found any difficulty in discerning a pointer from a setter, when
once he had been told the distinction, and his perceptive powers were not at
all deficient. I fancy they were quite as strong as those of the Rev. Mr
Stelling; for Tom could predict with accuracy what number of horses were
cantering behind him, he could throw a stone right into the centre of a given
ripple, he could guess to a fraction how many lengths of his stick it would
take to reach across the playground, and could draw almost perfect squares on
his slate without any measurement. But Mr Stelling took no note of these
things; he only observed that Tom&rsquo;s faculties failed him before the
abstractions hideously symbolised to him in the pages of the Eton Grammar, and
that he was in a state bordering on idiocy with regard to the demonstration
that two given triangles must be equal, though he could discern with great
promptitude and certainty the fact that they <i>were</i> equal. Whence Mr
Stelling concluded that Tom&rsquo;s brain, being peculiarly impervious to
etymology and demonstrations, was peculiarly in need of being ploughed and
harrowed by these patent implements; it was his favourite metaphor, that the
classics and geometry constituted that culture of the mind which prepared it
for the reception of any subsequent crop. I say nothing against Mr
Stelling&rsquo;s theory; if we are to have one regimen for all minds, his seems
to me as good as any other. I only know it turned out as uncomfortably for Tom
Tulliver as if he had been plied with cheese in order to remedy a gastric
weakness which prevented him from digesting it. It is astonishing what a
different result one gets by changing the metaphor! Once call the brain an
intellectual stomach, and one&rsquo;s ingenious conception of the classics and
geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to settle nothing. But then it is open to
some one else to follow great authorities, and call the mind a sheet of white
paper or a mirror, in which case one&rsquo;s knowledge of the digestive process
becomes quite irrelevant. It was doubtless an ingenious idea to call the camel
the ship of the desert, but it would hardly lead one far in training that
useful beast. O Aristotle! if you had had the advantage of being &ldquo;the
freshest modern&rdquo; instead of the greatest ancient, would you not have
mingled your praise of metaphorical speech, as a sign of high intelligence,
with a lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows itself in speech without
metaphor,&mdash;that we can so seldom declare what a thing is, except by saying
it is something else?
</p>

<p>
Tom Tulliver, being abundant in no form of speech, did not use any metaphor to
declare his views as to the nature of Latin; he never called it an instrument
of torture; and it was not until he had got on some way in the next half-year,
and in the Delectus, that he was advanced enough to call it a
&ldquo;bore&rdquo; and &ldquo;beastly stuff.&rdquo; At present, in relation to
this demand that he should learn Latin declensions and conjugations, Tom was in
a state of as blank unimaginativeness concerning the cause and tendency of his
sufferings, as if he had been an innocent shrewmouse imprisoned in the split
trunk of an ash-tree in order to cure lameness in cattle. It is doubtless
almost incredible to instructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve,
not belonging strictly to &ldquo;the masses,&rdquo; who are now understood to
have the monopoly of mental darkness, should have had no distinct idea how
there came to be such a thing as Latin on this earth; yet so it was with Tom.
It would have taken a long while to make conceivable to him that there ever
existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen, and transacted the
everyday affairs of life, through the medium of this language; and still
longer to make him understand why he should be called upon to learn it, when
its connection with those affairs had become entirely latent. So far as Tom had
gained any acquaintance with the Romans at Mr Jacob&rsquo;s academy, his
knowledge was strictly correct, but it went no farther than the fact that they
were &ldquo;in the New Testament&rdquo;; and Mr Stelling was not the man to
enfeeble and emasculate his pupil&rsquo;s mind by simplifying and explaining,
or to reduce the tonic effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering,
extraneous information, such as is given to girls.
</p>

<p>
Yet, strange to say, under this vigorous treatment Tom became more like a girl
than he had ever been in his life before. He had a large share of pride, which
had hitherto found itself very comfortable in the world, despising Old Goggles,
and reposing in the sense of unquestioned rights; but now this same pride met
with nothing but bruises and crushings. Tom was too clear-sighted not to be
aware that Mr Stelling&rsquo;s standard of things was quite different, was
certainly something higher in the eyes of the world than that of the people he
had been living amongst, and that, brought in contact with it, he, Tom
Tulliver, appeared uncouth and stupid; he was by no means indifferent to this,
and his pride got into an uneasy condition which quite nullified his boyish
self-satisfaction, and gave him something of the girl&rsquo;s susceptibility.
He was a very firm, not to say obstinate, disposition, but there was no
brute-like rebellion and recklessness in his nature; the human sensibilities
predominated, and if it had occurred to him that he could enable himself to
show some quickness at his lessons, and so acquire Mr Stelling&rsquo;s
approbation, by standing on one leg for an inconvenient length of time, or
rapping his head moderately against the wall, or any voluntary action of that
sort, he would certainly have tried it. But no; Tom had never heard that these
measures would brighten the understanding, or strengthen the verbal memory; and
he was not given to hypothesis and experiment. It did occur to him that he
could perhaps get some help by praying for it; but as the prayers he said every
evening were forms learned by heart, he rather shrank from the novelty and
irregularity of introducing an extempore passage on a topic of petition for
which he was not aware of any precedent. But one day, when he had broken down,
for the fifth time, in the supines of the third conjugation, and Mr Stelling,
convinced that this must be carelessness, since it transcended the bounds of
possible stupidity, had lectured him very seriously, pointing out that if he
failed to seize the present golden opportunity of learning supines, he would
have to regret it when he became a man,&mdash;Tom, more miserable than usual,
determined to try his sole resource; and that evening, after his usual form of
prayer for his parents and &ldquo;little sister&rdquo; (he had begun to pray
for Maggie when she was a baby), and that he might be able always to keep
God&rsquo;s commandments, he added, in the same low whisper, &ldquo;and please
to make me always remember my Latin.&rdquo; He paused a little to consider how
he should pray about Euclid&mdash;whether he should ask to see what it meant,
or whether there was any other mental state which would be more applicable to
the case. But at last he added: &ldquo;And make Mr Stelling say I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t do Euclid any more. Amen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fact that he got through his supines without mistake the next day,
encouraged him to persevere in this appendix to his prayers, and neutralised
any scepticism that might have arisen from Mr Stelling&rsquo;s continued
demand for Euclid. But his faith broke down under the apparent absence of all
help when he got into the irregular verbs. It seemed clear that Tom&rsquo;s
despair under the caprices of the present tense did not constitute a
<i>nodus</i> worthy of interference, and since this was the climax of his
difficulties, where was the use of praying for help any longer? He made up his
mind to this conclusion in one of his dull, lonely evenings, which he spent in
the study, preparing his lessons for the morrow. His eyes were apt to get dim
over the page, though he hated crying, and was ashamed of it; he couldn&rsquo;t
help thinking with some affection even of Spouncer, whom he used to fight and
quarrel with; he would have felt at home with Spouncer, and in a condition of
superiority. And then the mill, and the river, and Yap pricking up his ears,
ready to obey the least sign when Tom said, &ldquo;Hoigh!&rdquo; would all come
before him in a sort of calenture, when his fingers played absently in his
pocket with his great knife and his coil of whipcord, and other relics of the
past.
</p>

<p>
Tom, as I said, had never been so much like a girl in his life before, and at
that epoch of irregular verbs his spirit was further depressed by a new means
of mental development which had been thought of for him out of school hours.
Mrs Stelling had lately had her second baby, and as nothing could be more
salutary for a boy than to feel himself useful, Mrs Stelling considered she
was doing Tom a service by setting him to watch the little cherub Laura while
the nurse was occupied with the sickly baby. It was quite a pretty employment
for Tom to take little Laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day; it
would help to make him feel that Lorton Parsonage was a home for him, and that
he was one of the family. The little cherub Laura, not being an accomplished
walker at present, had a ribbon fastened round her waist, by which Tom held her
as if she had been a little dog during the minutes in which she chose to walk;
but as these were rare, he was for the most part carrying this fine child round
and round the garden, within sight of Mrs Stelling&rsquo;s window, according
to orders. If any one considers this unfair and even oppressive toward Tom, I
beg him to consider that there are feminine virtues which are with difficulty
combined, even if they are not incompatible. When the wife of a poor curate
contrives, under all her disadvantages, to dress extremely well, and to have a
style of coiffure which requires that her nurse shall occasionally officiate as
lady&rsquo;s-maid; when, moreover, her dinner-parties and her drawing-room show
that effort at elegance and completeness of appointment to which ordinary women
might imagine a large income necessary, it would be unreasonable to expect of
her that she should employ a second nurse, or even act as a nurse herself. Mr
Stelling knew better; he saw that his wife did wonders already, and was proud
of her. It was certainly not the best thing in the world for young
Tulliver&rsquo;s gait to carry a heavy child, but he had plenty of exercise in
long walks with himself, and next half-year Mr Stelling would see about having
a drilling-master. Among the many means whereby Mr Stelling intended to be
more fortunate than the bulk of his fellow-men, he had entirely given up that
of having his own way in his own house. What then? He had married &ldquo;as
kind a little soul as ever breathed,&rdquo; according to Mr Riley, who had
been acquainted with Mrs Stelling&rsquo;s blond ringlets and smiling demeanour
throughout her maiden life, and on the strength of that knowledge would have
been ready any day to pronounce that whatever domestic differences might arise
in her married life must be entirely Mr Stelling&rsquo;s fault.
</p>

<p>
If Tom had had a worse disposition, he would certainly have hated the little
cherub Laura, but he was too kind-hearted a lad for that; there was too much in
him of the fibre that turns to true manliness, and to protecting pity for the
weak. I am afraid he hated Mrs Stelling, and contracted a lasting dislike to
pale blond ringlets and broad plaits, as directly associated with haughtiness
of manner, and a frequent reference to other people&rsquo;s &ldquo;duty.&rdquo;
But he couldn&rsquo;t help playing with little Laura, and liking to amuse her;
he even sacrificed his percussion-caps for her sake, in despair of their ever
serving a greater purpose,&mdash;thinking the small flash and bang would
delight her, and thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from Mrs Stelling
for teaching her child to play with fire. Laura was a sort of
playfellow&mdash;and oh, how Tom longed for playfellows! In his secret heart he
yearned to have Maggie with him, and was almost ready to dote on her
exasperating acts of forgetfulness; though, when he was at home, he always
represented it as a great favour on his part to let Maggie trot by his side on
his pleasure excursions.
</p>

<p>
And before this dreary half-year was ended, Maggie actually came. Mrs Stelling
had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and stay with her
brother; so when Mr Tulliver drove over to King&rsquo;s Lorton late in
October, Maggie came too, with the sense that she was taking a great journey,
and beginning to see the world. It was Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s first visit to see
Tom, for the lad must learn not to think too much about home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my lad,&rdquo; he said to Tom, when Mr Stelling had left the room
to announce the arrival to his wife, and Maggie had begun to kiss Tom freely,
&ldquo;you look rarely! School agrees with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom wished he had looked rather ill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I <i>am</i> well, father,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;I
wish you&rsquo;d ask Mr Stelling not to let me do Euclid; it brings on the
toothache, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(The toothache was the only malady to which Tom had ever been subject.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Euclid, my lad,&mdash;why, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s definitions, and axioms, and
triangles, and things. It&rsquo;s a book I&rsquo;ve got to learn
in&mdash;there&rsquo;s no sense in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, reprovingly; &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
say so. You must learn what your master tells you. He knows what it&rsquo;s
right for you to learn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> help you now, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, with a little
air of patronizing consolation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m come to stay ever so long, if
Mrs Stelling asks me. I&rsquo;ve brought my box and my pinafores,
haven&rsquo;t I, father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> help me, you silly little thing!&rdquo; said Tom, in such
high spirits at this announcement that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding
Maggie by showing her a page of Euclid. &ldquo;I should like to see you doing
one of <i>my</i> lessons! Why, I learn Latin too! Girls never learn such
things. They&rsquo;re too silly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what Latin is very well,&rdquo; said Maggie, confidently,
&ldquo;Latin&rsquo;s a language. There are Latin words in the Dictionary.
There&rsquo;s bonus, a gift.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re just wrong there, Miss Maggie!&rdquo; said Tom,
secretly astonished. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re very wise! But
&lsquo;bonus&rsquo; means &lsquo;good,&rsquo; as it happens,&mdash;bonus, bona,
bonum.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s no reason why it shouldn&rsquo;t mean
&lsquo;gift,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Maggie, stoutly. &ldquo;It may mean several
things; almost every word does. There&rsquo;s &lsquo;lawn,&rsquo;&mdash;it
means the grass-plot, as well as the stuff pocket handkerchiefs are made
of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well done, little &rsquo;un,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, laughing, while
Tom felt rather disgusted with Maggie&rsquo;s knowingness, though beyond
measure cheerful at the thought that she was going to stay with him. Her
conceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Stelling, in her pressing invitation, did not mention a longer time than a
week for Maggie&rsquo;s stay; but Mr Stelling, who took her between his knees,
and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from, insisted that she must stay a
fortnight. Maggie thought Mr Stelling was a charming man, and Mr Tulliver was
quite proud to leave his little wench where she would have an opportunity of
showing her cleverness to appreciating strangers. So it was agreed that she
should not be fetched home till the end of the fortnight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then, come with me into the study, Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom, as
their father drove away. &ldquo;What do you shake and toss your head now for,
you silly?&rdquo; he continued; for though her hair was now under a new
dispensation, and was brushed smoothly behind her ears, she seemed still in
imagination to be tossing it out of her eyes. &ldquo;It makes you look as if
you were crazy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Maggie, impatiently.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease me, Tom. Oh, what books!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she
saw the bookcases in the study. &ldquo;How I should like to have as many books
as that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you couldn&rsquo;t read one of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Tom,
triumphantly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all Latin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, they aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;I can read the back of
this,&mdash;&lsquo;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what does that mean? <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tom,
wagging his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I could soon find out,&rdquo; said Maggie, scornfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, how?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should look inside, and see what it was about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not, Miss Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom, seeing her hand on
the volume. &ldquo;Mr Stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave, and
<i>I</i> shall catch it, if you take it out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very well. Let me see all <i>your</i> books, then,&rdquo; said
Maggie, turning to throw her arms round Tom&rsquo;s neck, and rub his cheek
with her small round nose.
</p>

<p>
Tom, in the gladness of his heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute with and
crow over again, seized her round the waist, and began to jump with her round
the large library table. Away they jumped with more and more vigor, till
Maggie&rsquo;s hair flew from behind her ears, and twirled about like an
animated mop. But the revolutions round the table became more and more
irregular in their sweep, till at last reaching Mr Stelling&rsquo;s reading
stand, they sent it thundering down with its heavy lexicons to the floor.
Happily it was the ground-floor, and the study was a one-storied wing to the
house, so that the downfall made no alarming resonance, though Tom stood dizzy
and aghast for a few minutes, dreading the appearance of Mr or Mrs Stelling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I say, Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom at last, lifting up the stand,
&ldquo;we must keep quiet here, you know. If we break anything Mrs
Stelling&rsquo;ll make us cry peccavi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the Latin for a good scolding,&rdquo; said Tom, not
without some pride in his knowledge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she a cross woman?&rdquo; said Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe you!&rdquo; said Tom, with an emphatic nod.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think all women are crosser than men,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;Aunt
Glegg&rsquo;s a great deal crosser than uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more
than father does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> be a woman some day,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;so <i>you</i> needn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I shall be a <i>clever</i> woman,&rdquo; said Maggie, with a toss.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say, and a nasty conceited thing. Everybody&rsquo;ll hate
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you oughtn&rsquo;t to hate me, Tom; it&rsquo;ll be very wicked of
you, for I shall be your sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but if you&rsquo;re a nasty disagreeable thing I <i>shall</i> hate
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but, Tom, you won&rsquo;t! I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be disagreeable. I
shall be very good to you, and I shall be good to everybody. You won&rsquo;t
hate me really, will you, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, bother! never mind! Come, it&rsquo;s time for me to learn my
lessons. See here! what I&rsquo;ve got to do,&rdquo; said Tom, drawing Maggie
toward him and showing her his theorem, while she pushed her hair behind her
ears, and prepared herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid.
She began to read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently,
becoming quite bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was
unavoidable; she must confess her incompetency, and she was not fond of
humiliation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and very ugly stuff; nobody
need want to make it out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, there, now, Miss Maggie!&rdquo; said Tom, drawing the book away, and
wagging his head at her, &ldquo;You see you&rsquo;re not so clever as you
thought you were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Maggie, pouting, &ldquo;I dare say I could make it out,
if I&rsquo;d learned what goes before, as you have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what you just couldn&rsquo;t, Miss Wisdom,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;For it&rsquo;s all the harder when you know what goes before; for
then you&rsquo;ve got to say what definition 3 is, and what axiom V. is. But
get along with you now; I must go on with this. Here&rsquo;s the Latin Grammar.
See what you can make of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her mathematical
mortification; for she delighted in new words, and quickly found that there was
an English Key at the end, which would make her very wise about Latin, at
slight expense. She presently made up her mind to skip the rules in the Syntax,
the examples became so absorbing. These mysterious sentences, snatched from an
unknown context,&mdash;like strange horns of beasts, and leaves of unknown
plants, brought from some far-off region,&mdash;gave boundless scope to her
imagination, and were all the more fascinating because they were in a peculiar
tongue of their own, which she could learn to interpret. It was really very
interesting, the Latin Grammar that Tom had said no girls could learn; and she
was proud because she found it interesting. The most fragmentary examples were
her favourites. <i>Mors omnibus est communis</i> would have been jejune, only
she liked to know the Latin; but the fortunate gentleman whom every one
congratulated because he had a son &ldquo;endowed with <i>such</i> a
disposition&rdquo; afforded her a great deal of pleasant conjecture, and she
was quite lost in the &ldquo;thick grove penetrable by no star,&rdquo; when Tom
called out,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then, Magsie, give us the Grammar!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom, it&rsquo;s such a pretty book!&rdquo; she said, as she jumped
out of the large arm-chair to give it him; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s much prettier than
the Dictionary. I could learn Latin very soon. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
at all hard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know what you&rsquo;ve been doing,&rdquo; said Tom;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been reading the English at the end. Any donkey can do
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business-like air, as
much as to say that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys would find
themselves equal to. Maggie, rather piqued, turned to the bookcases to amuse
herself with puzzling out the titles.
</p>

<p>
Presently Tom called to her: &ldquo;Here, Magsie, come and hear if I can say
this. Stand at that end of the table, where Mr Stelling sits when he hears
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie obeyed, and took the open book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where do you begin, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I begin at <i>&rsquo;Appellativa arborum,&rsquo;</i> because I say
all over again what I&rsquo;ve been learning this week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom sailed along pretty well for three lines; and Maggie was beginning to
forget her office of prompter in speculating as to what <i>mas</i> could mean,
which came twice over, when he stuck fast at <i>Sunt etiam volucrum</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me, Maggie; <i>Sunt etiam volucrum</i>&mdash;<i>Sunt
etiam volucrum</i>&mdash;<i>ut ostrea, cetus</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie, opening her mouth and shaking her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Sunt etiam volucrum</i>,&rdquo; said Tom, very slowly, as if the next
words might be expected to come sooner when he gave them this strong hint that
they were waited for.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;C, e, u,&rdquo; said Maggie, getting impatient.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know&mdash;hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;<i>Ceu
passer, hirundo; Ferarum</i>&mdash;<i>ferarum</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Tom took
his pencil and made several hard dots with it on his
book-cover&mdash;&ldquo;<i>ferarum</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;what a time you are!
<i>Ut</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ut ostrea</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;<i>ut tigris</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, now I can do,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;it was <i>tigris,
vulpes</i>, I&rsquo;d forgotten: <i>ut tigris, volupes; et Piscium</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With some further stammering and repetition, Tom got through the next few
lines.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the next is what I&rsquo;ve just
learned for to-morrow. Give me hold of the book a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After some whispered gabbling, assisted by the beating of his fist on the
table, Tom returned the book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mascula nomina in a</i>,&rdquo; he began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t come next.
It&rsquo;s <i>Nomen non creskens genittivo</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Creskens genittivo!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, with a derisive laugh,
for Tom had learned this omitted passage for his yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, and
a young gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive acquaintance with
Latin before he can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false quantity.
&ldquo;<i>Creskens genittivo!</i> What a little silly you are, Maggie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t laugh, Tom, for you didn&rsquo;t remember it at
all. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s spelt so; how was I to know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Phee-e-e-h! I told you girls couldn&rsquo;t learn Latin. It&rsquo;s
<i>Nomen non crescens genitivo</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Maggie, pouting. &ldquo;I can say that as
well as you can. And you don&rsquo;t mind your stops. For you ought to stop
twice as long at a semicolon as you do at a comma, and you make the longest
stops where there ought to be no stop at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, don&rsquo;t chatter. Let me go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the
drawing-room, and Maggie became so animated with Mr Stelling, who, she felt
sure, admired her cleverness, that Tom was rather amazed and alarmed at her
audacity. But she was suddenly subdued by Mr Stelling&rsquo;s alluding to a
little girl of whom he had heard that she once ran away to the gypsies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a very odd little girl that must be!&rdquo; said Mrs Stelling,
meaning to be playful; but a playfulness that turned on her supposed oddity was
not at all to Maggie&rsquo;s taste. She feared that Mr Stelling, after all,
did not think much of her, and went to bed in rather low spirits. Mrs
Stelling, she felt, looked at her as if she thought her hair was very ugly
because it hung down straight behind.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie, this visit to Tom. She
was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons, and in her various
readings got very deep into the examples in the Latin Grammar. The astronomer
who hated women generally caused her so much puzzling speculation that she one
day asked Mr Stelling if all astronomers hated women, or whether it was only
this particular astronomer. But forestalling his answer, she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all astronomers; because, you know, they live up in
high towers, and if the women came there they might talk and hinder them from
looking at the stars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Stelling liked her prattle immensely, and they were on the best terms. She
told Tom she should like to go to school to Mr Stelling, as he did, and learn
just the same things. She knew she could do Euclid, for she had looked into it
again, and she saw what A B C meant; they were the names of the lines.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you couldn&rsquo;t do it, now,&rdquo; said Tom;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll just ask Mr Stelling if you could.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said the little conceited minx,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Stelling,&rdquo; she said, that same evening when they were in the
drawing-room, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t I do Euclid, and all Tom&rsquo;s lessons,
if you were to teach me instead of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom, indignantly. &ldquo;Girls
can&rsquo;t do Euclid; can they, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They can pick up a little of everything, I dare say,&rdquo; said Mr
Stelling. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve a great deal of superficial cleverness; but they
couldn&rsquo;t go far into anything. They&rsquo;re quick and shallow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom, delighted with this verdict, telegraphed his triumph by wagging his head
at Maggie, behind Mr Stelling&rsquo;s chair. As for Maggie, she had hardly
ever been so mortified. She had been so proud to be called &ldquo;quick&rdquo;
all her little life, and now it appeared that this quickness was the brand of
inferiority. It would have been better to be slow, like Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha, ha! Miss Maggie!&rdquo; said Tom, when they were alone; &ldquo;you
see it&rsquo;s not such a fine thing to be quick. You&rsquo;ll never go far
into anything, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she had no spirit for
a retort.
</p>

<p>
But when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away in the gig
by Luke, and the study was once more quite lonely for Tom, he missed her
grievously. He had really been brighter, and had got through his lessons
better, since she had been there; and she had asked Mr Stelling so many
questions about the Roman Empire, and whether there really ever was a man who
said, in Latin, &ldquo;I would not buy it for a farthing or a rotten
nut,&rdquo; or whether that had only been turned into Latin, that Tom had
actually come to a dim understanding of the fact that there had once been
people upon the earth who were so fortunate as to know Latin without learning
it through the medium of the Eton Grammar. This luminous idea was a great
addition to his historical acquirements during this half-year, which were
otherwise confined to an epitomised history of the Jews.
</p>

<p>
But the dreary half-year <i>did</i> come to an end. How glad Tom was to see the
last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind! The dark afternoons and the
first December snow seemed to him far livelier than the August sunshine; and
that he might make himself the surer about the flight of the days that were
carrying him homeward, he stuck twenty-one sticks deep in a corner of the
garden, when he was three weeks from the holidays, and pulled one up every day
with a great wrench, throwing it to a distance with a vigor of will which would
have carried it to limbo, if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so
far.
</p>

<p>
But it was worth purchasing, even at the heavy price of the Latin Grammar, the
happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlour at home, as the gig passed
noiselessly over the snow-covered bridge; the happiness of passing from the
cold air to the warmth and the kisses and the smiles of that familiar hearth,
where the pattern of the rug and the grate and the fire-irons were &ldquo;first
ideas&rdquo; that it was no more possible to criticise than the solidity and
extension of matter. There is no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those
scenes where we were born, where objects became dear to us before we had known
the labour of choice, and where the outer world seemed only an extension of our
own personality; we accepted and loved it as we accepted our own sense of
existence and our own limbs. Very commonplace, even ugly, that furniture of our
early home might look if it were put up to auction; an improved taste in
upholstery scorns it; and is not the striving after something better and better
in our surroundings the grand characteristic that distinguishes man from the
brute, or, to satisfy a scrupulous accuracy of definition, that distinguishes
the British man from the foreign brute? But heaven knows where that striving
might lead us, if our affections had not a trick of twining round those old
inferior things; if the loves and sanctities of our life had no deep immovable
roots in memory. One&rsquo;s delight in an elderberry bush overhanging the
confused leafage of a hedgerow bank, as a more gladdening sight than the finest
cistus or fuchsia spreading itself on the softest undulating turf, is an
entirely unjustifiable preference to a nursery-gardener, or to any of those
regulated minds who are free from the weakness of any attachment that does not
rest on a demonstrable superiority of qualities. And there is no better reason
for preferring this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early memory; that it
is no novelty in my life, speaking to me merely through my present
sensibilities to form and colour, but the long companion of my existence, that
wove itself into my joys when joys were vivid.

The Christmas Holidays</h3>

<p>
Fine old Christmas, with the snowy hair and ruddy face, had done his duty that
year in the noblest fashion, and had set off his rich gifts of warmth and
colour with all the heightening contrast of frost and snow.
</p>

<p>
Snow lay on the croft and river-bank in undulations softer than the limbs of
infancy; it lay with the neatliest finished border on every sloping roof,
making the dark-red gables stand out with a new depth of colour; it weighed
heavily on the laurels and fir-trees, till it fell from them with a shuddering
sound; it clothed the rough turnip-field with whiteness, and made the sheep
look like dark blotches; the gates were all blocked up with the sloping drifts,
and here and there a disregarded four-footed beast stood as if petrified
&ldquo;in unrecumbent sadness&rdquo;; there was no gleam, no shadow, for the
heavens, too, were one still, pale cloud; no sound or motion in anything but
the dark river that flowed and moaned like an unresting sorrow. But old
Christmas smiled as he laid this cruel-seeming spell on the outdoor world, for
he meant to light up home with new brightness, to deepen all the richness of
indoor colour, and give a keener edge of delight to the warm fragrance of food;
he meant to prepare a sweet imprisonment that would strengthen the primitive
fellowship of kindred, and make the sunshine of familiar human faces as welcome
as the hidden day-star. His kindness fell but hardly on the
homeless,&mdash;fell but hardly on the homes where the hearth was not very
warm, and where the food had little fragrance; where the human faces had had no
sunshine in them, but rather the leaden, blank-eyed gaze of unexpectant want.
But the fine old season meant well; and if he has not learned the secret how to
bless men impartially, it is because his father Time, with ever-unrelenting
unrelenting purpose, still hides that secret in his own mighty, slow-beating
heart.
</p>

<p>
And yet this Christmas day, in spite of Tom&rsquo;s fresh delight in home, was
not, he thought, somehow or other, quite so happy as it had always been before.
The red berries were just as abundant on the holly, and he and Maggie had
dressed all the windows and mantlepieces and picture-frames on Christmas eve
with as much taste as ever, wedding the thick-set scarlet clusters with
branches of the black-berried ivy. There had been singing under the windows
after midnight,&mdash;supernatural singing, Maggie always felt, in spite of
Tom&rsquo;s contemptuous insistence that the singers were old Patch, the parish
clerk, and the rest of the church choir; she trembled with awe when their
carolling broke in upon her dreams, and the image of men in fustian clothes was
always thrust away by the vision of angels resting on the parted cloud. The
midnight chant had helped as usual to lift the morning above the level of
common days; and then there were the smell of hot toast and ale from the
kitchen, at the breakfast hour; the favourite anthem, the green boughs, and the
short sermon gave the appropriate festal character to the church-going; and
aunt and uncle Moss, with all their seven children, were looking like so many
reflectors of the bright parlour-fire, when the church-goers came back, stamping
the snow from their feet. The plum-pudding was of the same handsome roundness
as ever, and came in with the symbolic blue flames around it, as if it had been
heroically snatched from the nether fires, into which it had been thrown by
dyspeptic Puritans; the dessert was as splendid as ever, with its golden
oranges, brown nuts, and the crystalline light and dark of apple-jelly and
damson cheese; in all these things Christmas was as it had always been since
Tom could remember; it was only distinguished, it by anything, by superior
sliding and snowballs.
</p>

<p>
Christmas was cheery, but not so Mr Tulliver. He was irate and defiant; and
Tom, though he espoused his father&rsquo;s quarrels and shared his
father&rsquo;s sense of injury, was not without some of the feeling that
oppressed Maggie when Mr Tulliver got louder and more angry in narration and
assertion with the increased leisure of dessert. The attention that Tom might
have concentrated on his nuts and wine was distracted by a sense that there
were rascally enemies in the world, and that the business of grown-up life
could hardly be conducted without a good deal of quarrelling. Now, Tom was not
fond of quarrelling, unless it could soon be put an end to by a fair stand-up
fight with an adversary whom he had every chance of thrashing; and his
father&rsquo;s irritable talk made him uncomfortable, though he never accounted
to himself for the feeling, or conceived the notion that his father was faulty
in this respect.
</p>

<p>
The particular embodiment of the evil principle now exciting Mr
Tulliver&rsquo;s determined resistance was Mr Pivart, who, having lands higher
up the Ripple, was taking measures for their irrigation, which either were, or
would be, or were bound to be (on the principle that water was water), an
infringement on Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s legitimate share of water-power. Dix, who
had a mill on the stream, was a feeble auxiliary of Old Harry compared with
Pivart. Dix had been brought to his senses by arbitration, and Wakem&rsquo;s
advice had not carried <i>him</i> far. No; Dix, Mr Tulliver considered, had
been as good as nowhere in point of law; and in the intensity of his
indignation against Pivart, his contempt for a baffled adversary like Dix began
to wear the air of a friendly attachment. He had no male audience to-day except
Mr Moss, who knew nothing, as he said, of the &ldquo;natur&rsquo; o&rsquo;
mills,&rdquo; and could only assent to Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s arguments on the
<i>a priori</i> ground of family relationship and monetary obligation; but Mr
Tulliver did not talk with the futile intention of convincing his audience, he
talked to relieve himself; while good Mr Moss made strong efforts to keep his
eyes wide open, in spite of the sleepiness which an unusually good dinner
produced in his hard-worked frame. Mrs Moss, more alive to the subject, and
interested in everything that affected her brother, listened and put in a word
as often as maternal preoccupations allowed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Pivart&rsquo;s a new name hereabout, brother, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t own the land in father&rsquo;s
time, nor yours either, before I was married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;New name? Yes, I should think it <i>is</i> a new name,&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver, with angry emphasis. &ldquo;Dorlcote Mill&rsquo;s been in our family
a hundred year and better, and nobody ever heard of a Pivart meddling with the
river, till this fellow came and bought Bincome&rsquo;s farm out of hand,
before anybody else could so much as say &lsquo;snap.&rsquo; But I&rsquo;ll
<i>Pivart</i> him!&rdquo; added Mr Tulliver, lifting his glass with a sense
that he had defined his resolution in an unmistakable manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be forced to go to law with him, I hope, brother?&rdquo;
said Mrs Moss, with some anxiety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I shall be forced to; but I know what I shall
force <i>him</i> to, with his dikes and erigations, if there&rsquo;s any law to
be brought to bear o&rsquo; the right side. I know well enough who&rsquo;s at
the bottom of it; he&rsquo;s got Wakem to back him and egg him on. I know Wakem
tells him the law can&rsquo;t touch him for it, but there&rsquo;s folks can
handle the law besides Wakem. It takes a big raskil to beat him; but
there&rsquo;s bigger to be found, as know more o&rsquo; th&rsquo; ins and outs
o&rsquo; the law, else how came Wakem to lose Brumley&rsquo;s suit for
him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver was a strictly honest man, and proud of being honest, but he
considered that in law the ends of justice could only be achieved by employing
a stronger knave to frustrate a weaker. Law was a sort of cock-fight, in which
it was the business of injured honesty to get a game bird with the best pluck
and the strongest spurs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gore&rsquo;s no fool; you needn&rsquo;t tell me that,&rdquo; he observed
presently, in a pugnacious tone, as if poor Gritty had been urging that
lawyer&rsquo;s capabilities; &ldquo;but, you see, he isn&rsquo;t up to the law
as Wakem is. And water&rsquo;s a very particular thing; you can&rsquo;t pick it
up with a pitchfork. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s been nuts to Old Harry and the
lawyers. It&rsquo;s plain enough what&rsquo;s the rights and the wrongs of
water, if you look at it straight-forrard; for a river&rsquo;s a river, and if
you&rsquo;ve got a mill, you must have water to turn it; and it&rsquo;s no use
telling me Pivart&rsquo;s erigation and nonsense won&rsquo;t stop my wheel; I
know what belongs to water better than that. Talk to me o&rsquo; what th&rsquo;
engineers say! I say it&rsquo;s common sense, as Pivart&rsquo;s dikes must do
me an injury. But if that&rsquo;s their engineering, I&rsquo;ll put Tom to it
by-and-by, and he shall see if he can&rsquo;t find a bit more sense in
th&rsquo; engineering business than what <i>that</i> comes to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom, looking round with some anxiety at this announcement of his prospects,
unthinkingly withdrew a small rattle he was amusing baby Moss with, whereupon
she, being a baby that knew her own mind with remarkable clearness,
instantaneously expressed her sentiments in a piercing yell, and was not to be
appeased even by the restoration of the rattle, feeling apparently that the
original wrong of having it taken from her remained in all its force. Mrs Moss
hurried away with her into another room, and expressed to Mrs Tulliver, who
accompanied her, the conviction that the dear child had good reasons for
crying; implying that if it was supposed to be the rattle that baby clamored
for, she was a misunderstood baby. The thoroughly justifiable yell being
quieted, Mrs Moss looked at her sister-in-law and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to see brother so put out about this water work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your brother&rsquo;s way, Mrs Moss; I&rsquo;d never anything
o&rsquo; that sort before I was married,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, with a
half-implied reproach. She always spoke of her husband as &ldquo;your
brother&rdquo; to Mrs Moss in any case when his line of conduct was not matter
of pure admiration. Amiable Mrs Tulliver, who was never angry in her life, had
yet her mild share of that spirit without which she could hardly have been at
once a Dodson and a woman. Being always on the defensive toward her own
sisters, it was natural that she should be keenly conscious of her superiority,
even as the weakest Dodson, over a husband&rsquo;s sister, who, besides being
poorly off, and inclined to &ldquo;hang on&rdquo; her brother, had the
good-natured submissiveness of a large, easy-tempered, untidy, prolific woman,
with affection enough in her not only for her own husband and abundant
children, but for any number of collateral relations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope and pray he won&rsquo;t go to law,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss,
&ldquo;for there&rsquo;s never any knowing where that&rsquo;ll end. And the
right doesn&rsquo;t allays win. This Mr Pivart&rsquo;s a rich man, by what I
can make out, and the rich mostly get things their own way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, stroking her dress down,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen what riches are in my own family; for my sisters have
got husbands as can afford to do pretty much what they like. But I think
sometimes I shall be drove off my head with the talk about this law and
erigation; and my sisters lay all the fault to me, for they don&rsquo;t know
what it is to marry a man like your brother; how should they? Sister Pullet has
her own way from morning till night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should like my
husband if he hadn&rsquo;t got any wits of his own, and I had to find
head-piece for him. It&rsquo;s a deal easier to do what pleases one&rsquo;s
husband, than to be puzzling what else one should do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If people come to talk o&rsquo; doing what pleases their
husbands,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, with a faint imitation of her sister
Glegg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your brother might have waited a long while before
he&rsquo;d have found a wife that &rsquo;ud have let him have his say in
everything, as I do. It&rsquo;s nothing but law and erigation now, from when we
first get up in the morning till we go to bed at night; and I never contradict
him; I only say, &lsquo;Well, Mr Tulliver, do as you like; but whativer you
do, don&rsquo;t go to law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver, as we have seen, was not without influence over her husband. No
woman is; she can always incline him to do either what she wishes, or the
reverse; and on the composite impulses that were threatening to hurry Mr
Tulliver into &ldquo;law,&rdquo; Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s monotonous pleading had
doubtless its share of force; it might even be comparable to that proverbial
feather which has the credit or discredit of breaking the camel&rsquo;s back;
though, on a strictly impartial view, the blame ought rather to lie with the
previous weight of feathers which had already placed the back in such imminent
peril that an otherwise innocent feather could not settle on it without
mischief. Not that Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s feeble beseeching could have had this
feather&rsquo;s weight in virtue of her single personality; but whenever she
departed from entire assent to her husband, he saw in her the representative of
the Dodson family; and it was a guiding principle with Mr Tulliver to let the
Dodsons know that they were not to domineer over <i>him</i>, or&mdash;more
specifically&mdash;that a male Tulliver was far more than equal to four female
Dodsons, even though one of them was Mrs Glegg.
</p>

<p>
But not even a direct argument from that typical Dodson female herself against
his going to law could have heightened his disposition toward it so much as the
mere thought of Wakem, continually freshened by the sight of the too able
attorney on market-days. Wakem, to his certain knowledge, was (metaphorically
speaking) at the bottom of Pivart&rsquo;s irrigation; Wakem had tried to make
Dix stand out, and go to law about the dam; it was unquestionably Wakem who had
caused Mr Tulliver to lose the suit about the right of road and the bridge
that made a thoroughfare of his land for every vagabond who preferred an
opportunity of damaging private property to walking like an honest man along
the highroad; all lawyers were more or less rascals, but Wakem&rsquo;s
rascality was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself in
opposition to that form of right embodied in Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s interests and
opinions. And as an extra touch of bitterness, the injured miller had recently,
in borrowing the five hundred pounds, been obliged to carry a little business
to Wakem&rsquo;s office on his own account. A hook-nosed glib fellow! as cool
as a cucumber,&mdash;always looking so sure of his game! And it was vexatious
that Lawyer Gore was not more like him, but was a bald, round-featured man,
with bland manners and fat hands; a game-cock that you would be rash to bet
upon against Wakem. Gore was a sly fellow. His weakness did not lie on the side
of scrupulosity; but the largest amount of winking, however significant, is not
equivalent to seeing through a stone wall; and confident as Mr Tulliver was in
his principle that water was water, and in the direct inference that Pivart had
not a leg to stand on in this affair of irrigation, he had an uncomfortable
suspicion that Wakem had more law to show against this (rationally)
irrefragable inference than Gore could show for it. But then, if they went to
law, there was a chance for Mr Tulliver to employ Counsellor Wylde on his
side, instead of having that admirable bully against him; and the prospect of
seeing a witness of Wakem&rsquo;s made to perspire and become confounded, as
Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s witness had once been, was alluring to the love of
retributive justice.
</p>

<p>
Much rumination had Mr Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his rides on
the gray horse; much turning of the head from side to side, as the scales
dipped alternately; but the probable result was still out of sight, only to be
reached through much hot argument and iteration in domestic and social life.
That initial stage of the dispute which consisted in the narration of the case
and the enforcement of Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s views concerning it throughout the
entire circle of his connections would necessarily take time; and at the
beginning of February, when Tom was going to school again, there were scarcely
any new items to be detected in his father&rsquo;s statement of the case
against Pivart, or any more specific indication of the measures he was bent on
taking against that rash contravener of the principle that water was water.
Iteration, like friction, is likely to generate heat instead of progress, and
Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s heat was certainly more and more palpable. If there had
been no new evidence on any other point, there had been new evidence that
Pivart was as &ldquo;thick as mud&rdquo; with Wakem.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Tom, one evening near the end of the holidays,
&ldquo;uncle Glegg says Lawyer Wakem <i>is</i> going to send his son to Mr
Stelling. It isn&rsquo;t true, what they said about his going to be sent to
France. You won&rsquo;t like me to go to school with Wakem&rsquo;s son, shall
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter for that, my boy,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you learn anything bad of him, that&rsquo;s all. The
lad&rsquo;s a poor deformed creatur, and takes after his mother in the face; I
think there isn&rsquo;t much of his father in him. It&rsquo;s a sign Wakem
thinks high o&rsquo; Mr Sterling, as he sends his son to him, and Wakem knows
meal from bran.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver in his heart was rather proud of the fact that his son was to have
the same advantages as Wakem&rsquo;s; but Tom was not at all easy on the point.
It would have been much clearer if the lawyer&rsquo;s son had not been
deformed, for then Tom would have had the prospect of pitching into him with
all that freedom which is derived from a high moral sanction.

<h3><a name="chap16"></a>Chapter III.<br/>
The New Schoolfellow</h3>

<p>
It was a cold, wet January day on which Tom went back to school; a day quite in
keeping with this severe phase of his destiny. If he had not carried in his
pocket a parcel of sugar-candy and a small Dutch doll for little Laura, there
would have been no ray of expected pleasure to enliven the general gloom. But
he liked to think how Laura would put out her lips and her tiny hands for the
bits of sugarcandy; and to give the greater keenness to these pleasures of
imagination, he took out the parcel, made a small hole in the paper, and bit
off a crystal or two, which had so solacing an effect under the confined
prospect and damp odors of the gig-umbrella, that he repeated the process more
than once on his way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Tulliver, we&rsquo;re glad to see you again,&rdquo; said Mr
Stelling, heartily. &ldquo;Take off your wrappings and come into the study till
dinner. You&rsquo;ll find a bright fire there, and a new companion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen comforter and
other wrappings. He had seen Philip Wakem at St Ogg&rsquo;s, but had always
turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible. He would have disliked
having a deformed boy for his companion, even if Philip had not been the son of
a bad man. And Tom did not see how a bad man&rsquo;s son could be very good.
His own father was a good man, and he would readily have fought any one who
said the contrary. He was in a state of mingled embarrassment and defiance as
he followed Mr Stelling to the study.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here is a new companion for you to shake hands with, Tulliver,&rdquo;
said that gentleman on entering the study,&mdash;&ldquo;Master Philip Wakem. I
shall leave you to make acquaintance by yourselves. You already know something
of each other, I imagine; for you are neighbours at home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom looked confused and awkward, while Philip rose and glanced at him timidly.
Tom did not like to go up and put out his hand, and he was not prepared to say,
&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; on so short a notice.
</p>

<p>
Mr Stelling wisely turned away, and closed the door behind him; boys&rsquo;
shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders.
</p>

<p>
Philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward Tom. He thought, or
rather felt, that Tom had an aversion to looking at him; every one, almost,
disliked looking at him; and his deformity was more conspicuous when he walked.
So they remained without shaking hands or even speaking, while Tom went to the
fire and warmed himself, every now and then casting furtive glances at Philip,
who seemed to be drawing absently first one object and then another on a piece
of paper he had before him. He had seated himself again, and as he drew, was
thinking what he could say to Tom, and trying to overcome his own repugnance to
making the first advances.
</p>

<p>
Tom began to look oftener and longer at Philip&rsquo;s face, for he could see
it without noticing the hump, and it was really not a disagreeable
face,&mdash;very old-looking, Tom thought. He wondered how much older Philip
was than himself. An anatomist&mdash;even a mere physiognomist&mdash;would have
seen that the deformity of Philip&rsquo;s spine was not a congenital hump, but
the result of an accident in infancy; but you do not expect from Tom any
acquaintance with such distinctions; to him, Philip was simply a humpback. He
had a vague notion that the deformity of Wakem&rsquo;s son had some relation to
the lawyer&rsquo;s rascality, of which he had so often heard his father talk
with hot emphasis; and he felt, too, a half-admitted fear of him as probably a
spiteful fellow, who, not being able to fight you, had cunning ways of doing
you a mischief by the sly. There was a humpbacked tailor in the neighbourhood
of Mr Jacobs&rsquo;s academy, who was considered a very unamiable character,
and was much hooted after by public-spirited boys solely on the ground of his
unsatisfactory moral qualities; so that Tom was not without a basis of fact to
go upon. Still, no face could be more unlike that ugly tailor&rsquo;s than this
melancholy boy&rsquo;s face,&mdash;the brown hair round it waved and curled at
the ends like a girl&rsquo;s; Tom thought that truly pitiable. This Wakem was a
pale, puny fellow, and it was quite clear he would not be able to play at
anything worth speaking of; but he handled his pencil in an enviable manner,
and was apparently making one thing after another without any trouble. What was
he drawing? Tom was quite warm now, and wanted something new to be going
forward. It was certainly more agreeable to have an ill-natured humpback as a
companion than to stand looking out of the study window at the rain, and
kicking his foot against the washboard in solitude; something would happen
every day,&mdash;&ldquo;a quarrel or something&rdquo;; and Tom thought he
should rather like to show Philip that he had better not try his spiteful
tricks on <i>him</i>. He suddenly walked across the hearth and looked over
Philip&rsquo;s paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a donkey with panniers, and a spaniel, and partridges
in the corn!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his tongue being completely loosed by
surprise and admiration. &ldquo;Oh my buttons! I wish I could draw like that.
I&rsquo;m to learn drawing this half; I wonder if I shall learn to make dogs
and donkeys!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you can do them without learning,&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;I never
learned drawing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never learned?&rdquo; said Tom, in amazement. &ldquo;Why, when I make
dogs and horses, and those things, the heads and the legs won&rsquo;t come
right; though I can see how they ought to be very well. I can make houses, and
all sorts of chimneys,&mdash;chimneys going all down the wall,&mdash;and
windows in the roof, and all that. But I dare say I could do dogs and horses if
I was to try more,&rdquo; he added, reflecting that Philip might falsely
suppose that he was going to &ldquo;knock under,&rdquo; if he were too frank
about the imperfection of his accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very easy. You&rsquo;ve
only to look well at things, and draw them over and over again. What you do
wrong once, you can alter the next time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you been taught <i>any</i>thing?&rdquo; said Tom,
beginning to have a puzzled suspicion that Philip&rsquo;s crooked back might be
the source of remarkable faculties. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d been to school
a long while.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip, smiling; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taught Latin
and Greek and mathematics, and writing and such things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but I say, you don&rsquo;t like Latin, though, do you?&rdquo; said
Tom, lowering his voice confidentially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty well; I don&rsquo;t care much about it,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but perhaps you haven&rsquo;t got into the <i>Propria quæ
maribus</i>,&rdquo; said Tom, nodding his head sideways, as much as to say,
&ldquo;that was the test; it was easy talking till you came to
<i>that</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt some bitter complacency in the promising stupidity of this
well-made, active-looking boy; but made polite by his own extreme
sensitiveness, as well as by his desire to conciliate, he checked his
inclination to laugh, and said quietly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done with the grammar; I don&rsquo;t learn that any
more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t have the same lessons as I shall?&rdquo; said Tom,
with a sense of disappointment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; but I dare say I can help you. I shall be very glad to help you if I
can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom did not say &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; for he was quite absorbed in the
thought that Wakem&rsquo;s son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have
been expected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;do you love your father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip, colouring deeply; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you love
yours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;I only wanted to know,&rdquo; said Tom, rather ashamed of
himself, now he saw Philip colouring and looking uncomfortable. He found much
difficulty in adjusting his attitude of mind toward the son of Lawyer Wakem,
and it had occurred to him that if Philip disliked his father, that fact might
go some way toward clearing up his perplexity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall you learn drawing now?&rdquo; he said, by way of changing the
subject.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;My father wishes me to give all my time
to other things now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! Latin and Euclid, and those things?&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip, who had left off using his pencil, and was
resting his head on one hand, while Tom was learning forward on both elbows,
and looking with increasing admiration at the dog and the donkey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t mind that?&rdquo; said Tom, with strong curiosity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; I like to know what everybody else knows. I can study what I like
by-and-by.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why anybody should learn Latin,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the education of a gentleman,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;All gentlemen learn the same things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! do you think Sir John Crake, the master of the harriers, knows
Latin?&rdquo; said Tom, who had often thought he should like to resemble Sir
John Crake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He learned it when he was a boy, of course,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;But I dare say he&rsquo;s forgotten it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, I can do that, then,&rdquo; said Tom, not with any
epigrammatic intention, but with serious satisfaction at the idea that, as far
as Latin was concerned, there was no hindrance to his resembling Sir John
Crake. &ldquo;Only you&rsquo;re obliged to remember it while you&rsquo;re at
school, else you&rsquo;ve got to learn ever so many lines of
&lsquo;Speaker.&rsquo; Mr Stelling&rsquo;s very particular&mdash;did you know?
He&rsquo;ll have you up ten times if you say &lsquo;nam&rsquo; for
&lsquo;jam,&rsquo;&mdash;he won&rsquo;t let you go a letter wrong, <i>I</i> can
tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Philip, unable to choke a laugh;
&ldquo;I can remember things easily. And there are some lessons I&rsquo;m very
fond of. I&rsquo;m very fond of Greek history, and everything about the Greeks.
I should like to have been a Greek and fought the Persians, and then have come
home and have written tragedies, or else have been listened to by everybody for
my wisdom, like Socrates, and have died a grand death.&rdquo; (Philip, you
perceive, was not without a wish to impress the well-made barbarian with a
sense of his mental superiority.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, were the Greeks great fighters?&rdquo; said Tom, who saw a vista in
this direction. &ldquo;Is there anything like David and Goliath and Samson in
the Greek history? Those are the only bits I like in the history of the
Jews.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there are very fine stories of that sort about the
Greeks,&mdash;about the heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts, as
Samson did. And in the Odyssey&mdash;that&rsquo;s a beautiful
poem&mdash;there&rsquo;s a more wonderful giant than Goliath,&mdash;Polypheme,
who had only one eye in the middle of his forehead; and Ulysses, a little
fellow, but very wise and cunning, got a red-hot pine-tree and stuck it into
this one eye, and made him roar like a thousand bulls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what fun!&rdquo; said Tom, jumping away from the table, and stamping
first with one leg and then the other. &ldquo;I say, can you tell me all about
those stories? Because I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t learn Greek, you know. Shall
I?&rdquo; he added, pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm, lest the
contrary might be possible. &ldquo;Does every gentleman learn Greek? Will Mr
Stelling make me begin with it, do you think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I should think not, very likely not,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;But
you may read those stories without knowing Greek. I&rsquo;ve got them in
English.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but I don&rsquo;t like reading; I&rsquo;d sooner have you tell them
me. But only the fighting ones, you know. My sister Maggie is always wanting to
tell me stories, but they&rsquo;re stupid things. Girls&rsquo; stories always
are. Can you tell a good many fighting stories?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;lots of them, besides the Greek
stories. I can tell you about Richard Cœur-de-Lion and Saladin, and about
William Wallace and Robert Bruce and James Douglas,&mdash;I know no end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re older than I am, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, how old are <i>you?</i> I&rsquo;m fifteen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going in fourteen,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;But I thrashed
all the fellows at Jacob&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s where I was before I came
here. And I beat &rsquo;em all at bandy and climbing. And I wish Mr Stelling
would let us go fishing. <i>I</i> could show you how to fish. You <i>could</i>
fish, couldn&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s only standing, and sitting still, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom, in his turn, wished to make the balance dip in his favour. This hunchback
must not suppose that his acquaintance with fighting stories put him on a par
with an actual fighting hero, like Tom Tulliver. Philip winced under this
allusion to his unfitness for active sports, and he answered almost
peevishly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear fishing. I think people look like fools sitting
watching a line hour after hour, or else throwing and throwing, and catching
nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but you wouldn&rsquo;t say they looked like fools when they landed a
big pike, I can tell you,&rdquo; said Tom, who had never caught anything that
was &ldquo;big&rdquo; in his life, but whose imagination was on the stretch
with indignant zeal for the honour of sport. Wakem&rsquo;s son, it was plain,
had his disagreeable points, and must be kept in due check. Happily for the
harmony of this first interview, they were now called to dinner, and Philip was
not allowed to develop farther his unsound views on the subject of fishing. But
Tom said to himself, that was just what he should have expected from a
hunchback.

<h3><a name="chap17"></a>Chapter IV.<br/>
&ldquo;The Young Idea&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
The alterations of feeling in that first dialogue between Tom and Philip
continued to make their intercourse even after many weeks of schoolboy
intimacy. Tom never quite lost the feeling that Philip, being the son of a
&ldquo;rascal,&rdquo; was his natural enemy; never thoroughly overcame his
repulsion to Philip&rsquo;s deformity. He was a boy who adhered tenaciously to
impressions once received; as with all minds in which mere perception
predominates over thought and emotion, the external remained to him rigidly
what it was in the first instance. But then it was impossible not to like
Philip&rsquo;s company when he was in a good humour; he could help one so well
in one&rsquo;s Latin exercises, which Tom regarded as a kind of puzzle that
could only be found out by a lucky chance; and he could tell such wonderful
fighting stories about Hal of the Wynd, for example, and other heroes who were
especial favourites with Tom, because they laid about them with heavy strokes.
He had small opinion of Saladin, whose cimeter could cut a cushion in two in an
instant; who wanted to cut cushions? That was a stupid story, and he
didn&rsquo;t care to hear it again. But when Robert Bruce, on the black pony,
rose in his stirrups, and lifting his good battle-axe, cracked at once the
helmet and the skull of the too hasty knight at Bannockburn, then Tom felt all
the exaltation of sympathy, and if he had had a cocoanut at hand, he would have
cracked it at once with the poker. Philip in his happier moods indulged Tom to
the top of his bent, heightening the crash and bang and fury of every fight
with all the artillery of epithets and similes at his command. But he was not
always in a good humour or happy mood. The slight spurt of peevish
susceptibility which had escaped him in their first interview was a symptom of
a perpetually recurring mental ailment, half of it nervous irritability, half
of it the heart-bitterness produced by the sense of his deformity. In these
fits of susceptibility every glance seemed to him to be charged either with
offensive pity or with ill-repressed disgust; at the very least it was an
indifferent glance, and Philip felt indifference as a child of the south feels
the chill air of a northern spring. Poor Tom&rsquo;s blundering patronage when
they were out of doors together would sometimes make him turn upon the
well-meaning lad quite savagely; and his eyes, usually sad and quiet, would
flash with anything but playful lightning. No wonder Tom retained his
suspicions of the humpback.
</p>

<p>
But Philip&rsquo;s self-taught skill in drawing was another link between them;
for Tom found, to his disgust, that his new drawing-master gave him no dogs and
donkeys to draw, but brooks and rustic bridges and ruins, all with a general
softness of black-lead surface, indicating that nature, if anything, was rather
satiny; and as Tom&rsquo;s feeling for the picturesque in landscape was at
present quite latent, it is not surprising that Mr Goodrich&rsquo;s
productions seemed to him an uninteresting form of art. Mr Tulliver, having a
vague intention that Tom should be put to some business which included the
drawing out of plans and maps, had complained to Mr Riley, when he saw him at
Mudport, that Tom seemed to be learning nothing of that sort; whereupon that
obliging adviser had suggested that Tom should have drawing-lessons. Mr
Tulliver must not mind paying extra for drawing; let Tom be made a good
draughtsman, and he would be able to turn his pencil to any purpose. So it was
ordered that Tom should have drawing-lessons; and whom should Mr Stelling have
selected as a master if not Mr Goodrich, who was considered quite at the head
of his profession within a circuit of twelve miles round King&rsquo;s Lorton?
By which means Tom learned to make an extremely fine point to his pencil, and
to represent landscape with a &ldquo;broad generality,&rdquo; which, doubtless
from a narrow tendency in his mind to details, he thought extremely dull.
</p>

<p>
All this, you remember, happened in those dark ages when there were no schools
of design; before schoolmasters were invariably men of scrupulous integrity,
and before the clergy were all men of enlarged minds and varied culture. In
those less favoured days, it is no fable that there were other clergymen
besides Mr Stelling who had narrow intellects and large wants, and whose
income, by a logical confusion to which Fortune, being a female as well as
blindfold, is peculiarly liable, was proportioned not to their wants but to
their intellect, with which income has clearly no inherent relation. The
problem these gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between
their wants and their income; and since wants are not easily starved to death,
the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income. There was but one way
of doing this; any of those low callings in which men are obliged to do good
work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen; was it their fault if their
only resource was to turn out very poor work at a high price? Besides, how
should Mr Stelling be expected to know that education was a delicate and
difficult business, any more than an animal endowed with a power of boring a
hole through a rock should be expected to have wide views of excavation? Mr
Stelling&rsquo;s faculties had been early trained to boring in a straight line,
and he had no faculty to spare. But among Tom&rsquo;s contemporaries, whose
fathers cast their sons on clerical instruction to find them ignorant after
many days, there were many far less lucky than Tom Tulliver. Education was
almost entirely a matter of luck&mdash;usually of ill-luck&mdash;in those
distant days. The state of mind in which you take a billiard-cue or a dice-box
in your hand is one of sober certainty compared with that of old-fashioned
fathers, like Mr Tulliver, when they selected a school or a tutor for their
sons. Excellent men, who had been forced all their lives to spell on an
impromptu-phonetic system, and having carried on a successful business in spite
of this disadvantage, had acquired money enough to give their sons a better
start in life than they had had themselves, must necessarily take their chance
as to the conscience and the competence of the schoolmaster whose circular fell
in their way, and appeared to promise so much more than they would ever have
thought of asking for, including the return of linen, fork, and spoon. It was
happy for them if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not brought
up his son to the Church, and if that young gentleman, at the age of
four-and-twenty, had not closed his college dissipations by an imprudent
marriage; otherwise, these innocent fathers, desirous of doing the best for
their offspring, could only escape the draper&rsquo;s son by happening to be on
the foundation of a grammar-school as yet unvisited by commissioners, where two
or three boys could have, all to themselves, the advantages of a large and
lofty building, together with a head-master, toothless, dim-eyed and deaf,
whose erudite indistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate
of three hundred pounds a-head,&mdash;a ripe scholar, doubtless, when first
appointed; but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less esteemed
in the market.
</p>

<p>
Tom Tulliver, then, compared with many other British youths of his time who
have since had to scramble through life with some fragments of more or less
relevant knowledge, and a great deal of strictly relevant ignorance, was not so
very unlucky. Mr Stelling was a broad-chested, healthy man, with the bearing
of a gentleman, a conviction that a growing boy required a sufficiency of beef,
and a certain hearty kindness in him that made him like to see Tom looking well
and enjoying his dinner; not a man of refined conscience, or with any deep
sense of the infinite issues belonging to everyday duties, not quite competent
to his high offices; but incompetent gentlemen must live, and without private
fortune it is difficult to see how they could all live genteelly if they had
nothing to do with education or government. Besides, it was the fault of
Tom&rsquo;s mental constitution that his faculties could not be nourished on
the sort of knowledge Mr Stelling had to communicate. A boy born with a
deficient power of apprehending signs and abstractions must suffer the penalty
of his congenital deficiency, just as if he had been born with one leg shorter
than the other. A method of education sanctioned by the long practice of our
venerable ancestors was not to give way before the exceptional dulness of a boy
who was merely living at the time then present. And Mr Stelling was convinced
that a boy so stupid at signs and abstractions must be stupid at everything
else, even if that reverend gentleman could have taught him everything else. It
was the practice of our venerable ancestors to apply that ingenious instrument
the thumb-screw, and to tighten and tighten it in order to elicit non-existent
facts; they had a fixed opinion to begin with, that the facts were existent,
and what had they to do but to tighten the thumb-screw? In like manner, Mr
Stelling had a fixed opinion that all boys with any capacity could learn what
it was the only regular thing to teach; if they were slow, the thumb-screw must
be tightened,&mdash;the exercises must be insisted on with increased severity,
and a page of Virgil be awarded as a penalty, to encourage and stimulate a too
languid inclination to Latin verse.
</p>

<p>
The thumb-screw was a little relaxed, however, during this second half-year.
Philip was so advanced in his studies, and so apt, that Mr Stelling could
obtain credit by his facility, which required little help, much more easily
than by the troublesome process of overcoming Tom&rsquo;s dulness. Gentlemen
with broad chests and ambitious intentions do sometimes disappoint their
friends by failing to carry the world before them. Perhaps it is that high
achievements demand some other unusual qualification besides an unusual desire
for high prizes; perhaps it is that these stalwart gentlemen are rather
indolent, their <i>divinæ particulum auræ</i> being obstructed from soaring by
a too hearty appetite. Some reason or other there was why Mr Stelling deferred
the execution of many spirited projects,&mdash;why he did not begin the editing
of his Greek play, or any other work of scholarship, in his leisure hours, but,
after turning the key of his private study with much resolution, sat down to
one of Theodore Hook&rsquo;s novels. Tom was gradually allowed to shuffle
through his lessons with less rigor, and having Philip to help him, he was able
to make some show of having applied his mind in a confused and blundering way,
without being cross-examined into a betrayal that his mind had been entirely
neutral in the matter. He thought school much more bearable under this
modification of circumstances; and he went on contentedly enough, picking up a
promiscuous education chiefly from things that were not intended as education
at all. What was understood to be his education was simply the practice of
reading, writing, and spelling, carried on by an elaborate appliance of
unintelligible ideas, and by much failure in the effort to learn by rote.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, there was a visible improvement in Tom under this training;
perhaps because he was not a boy in the abstract, existing solely to illustrate
the evils of a mistaken education, but a boy made of flesh and blood, with
dispositions not entirely at the mercy of circumstances.
</p>

<p>
There was a great improvement in his bearing, for example; and some credit on
this score was due to Mr Poulter, the village schoolmaster, who, being an old
Peninsular soldier, was employed to drill Tom,&mdash;a source of high mutual
pleasure. Mr Poulter, who was understood by the company at the Black Swan to
have once struck terror into the hearts of the French, was no longer personally
formidable. He had rather a shrunken appearance, and was tremulous in the
mornings, not from age, but from the extreme perversity of the King&rsquo;s
Lorton boys, which nothing but gin could enable him to sustain with any
firmness. Still, he carried himself with martial erectness, had his clothes
scrupulously brushed, and his trousers tightly strapped; and on the Wednesday
and Saturday afternoons, when he came to Tom, he was always inspired with gin
and old memories, which gave him an exceptionally spirited air, as of a
superannuated charger who hears the drum. The drilling-lessons were always
protracted by episodes of warlike narrative, much more interesting to Tom than
Philip&rsquo;s stories out of the Iliad; for there were no cannon in the Iliad,
and besides, Tom had felt some disgust on learning that Hector and Achilles
might possibly never have existed. But the Duke of Wellington was really alive,
and Bony had not been long dead; therefore Mr Poulter&rsquo;s reminiscences of
the Peninsular War were removed from all suspicion of being mythical. Mr
Poulter, it appeared, had been a conspicuous figure at Talavera, and had
contributed not a little to the peculiar terror with which his regiment of
infantry was regarded by the enemy. On afternoons when his memory was more
stimulated than usual, he remembered that the Duke of Wellington had (in strict
privacy, lest jealousies should be awakened) expressed his esteem for that fine
fellow Poulter. The very surgeon who attended him in the hospital after he had
received his gunshot-wound had been profoundly impressed with the superiority
of Mr Poulter&rsquo;s flesh,&mdash;no other flesh would have healed in
anything like the same time. On less personal matters connected with the
important warfare in which he had been engaged, Mr Poulter was more reticent,
only taking care not to give the weight of his authority to any loose notions
concerning military history. Any one who pretended to a knowledge of what
occurred at the siege of Badajos was especially an object of silent pity to Mr
Poulter; he wished that prating person had been run down, and had the breath
trampled out of him at the first go-off, as he himself had,&mdash;he might talk
about the siege of Badajos then! Tom did not escape irritating his
drilling-master occasionally, by his curiosity concerning other military
matters than Mr Poulter&rsquo;s personal experience.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And General Wolfe, Mr Poulter,&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t he a wonderful
fighter?&rdquo; said Tom, who held the notion that all the martial heroes
commemorated on the public-house signs were engaged in the war with Bony.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; said Mr Poulter, contemptuously. &ldquo;Nothing
o&rsquo; the sort! Heads up!&rdquo; he added, in a tone of stern command, which
delighted Tom, and made him feel as if he were a regiment in his own person.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Mr Poulter would continue, on coming to a pause in his
discipline; &ldquo;they&rsquo;d better not talk to me about General Wolfe. He
did nothing but die of his wound; that&rsquo;s a poor haction, I consider. Any
other man &rsquo;ud have died o&rsquo; the wounds I&rsquo;ve had. One of my
sword-cuts &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; killed a fellow like General Wolfe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Poulter,&rdquo; Tom would say, at any allusion to the sword,
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d bring your sword and do the sword-exercise!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a long while Mr Poulter only shook his head in a significant manner at
this request, and smiled patronizingly, as Jupiter may have done when Semele
urged her too ambitious request. But one afternoon, when a sudden shower of
heavy rain had detained Mr Poulter twenty minutes longer than usual at the
Black Swan, the sword was brought,&mdash;just for Tom to look at.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this is the real sword you fought with in all the battles, Mr
Poulter?&rdquo; said Tom, handling the hilt. &ldquo;Has it ever cut a
Frenchman&rsquo;s head off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Head off? Ah! and would, if he&rsquo;d had three heads.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you had a gun and bayonet besides?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
should like the gun and bayonet best, because you could shoot &rsquo;em first
and spear &rsquo;em after. Bang! Ps-s-s-s!&rdquo; Tom gave the requisite
pantomime to indicate the double enjoyment of pulling the trigger and thrusting
the spear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but the sword&rsquo;s the thing when you come to close
fighting,&rdquo; said Mr Poulter, involuntarily falling in with Tom&rsquo;s
enthusiasm, and drawing the sword so suddenly that Tom leaped back with much
agility.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but, Mr Poulter, if you&rsquo;re going to do the exercise,&rdquo;
said Tom, a little conscious that he had not stood his ground as became an
Englishman, &ldquo;let me go and call Philip. He&rsquo;ll like to see you, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! the humpbacked lad?&rdquo; said Mr Poulter, contemptuously;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of <i>his</i> looking on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but he knows a great deal about fighting,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;and how they used to fight with bows and arrows, and battle-axes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him come, then. I&rsquo;ll show him something different from his
bows and arrows,&rdquo; said Mr Poulter, coughing and drawing himself up,
while he gave a little preliminary play to his wrist.
</p>

<p>
Tom ran in to Philip, who was enjoying his afternoon&rsquo;s holiday at the
piano, in the drawing-room, picking out tunes for himself and singing them. He
was supremely happy, perched like an amorphous bundle on the high stool, with
his head thrown back, his eyes fixed on the opposite cornice, and his lips wide
open, sending forth, with all his might, impromptu syllables to a tune of
Arne&rsquo;s which had hit his fancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, Philip,&rdquo; said Tom, bursting in; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stay
roaring &lsquo;la la&rsquo; there; come and see old Poulter do his
sword-exercise in the carriage-house!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The jar of this interruption, the discord of Tom&rsquo;s tones coming across
the notes to which Philip was vibrating in soul and body, would have been
enough to unhinge his temper, even if there had been no question of Poulter the
drilling-master; and Tom, in the hurry of seizing something to say to prevent
Mr Poulter from thinking he was afraid of the sword when he sprang away from
it, had alighted on this proposition to fetch Philip, though he knew well
enough that Philip hated to hear him mention his drilling-lessons. Tom would
never have done so inconsiderate a thing except under the severe stress of his
personal pride.
</p>

<p>
Philip shuddered visibly as he paused from his music. Then turning red, he
said, with violent passion,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get away, you lumbering idiot! Don&rsquo;t come bellowing at me;
you&rsquo;re not fit to speak to anything but a cart-horse!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not the first time Philip had been made angry by him, but Tom had never
before been assailed with verbal missiles that he understood so well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fit to speak to something better than you, you poor-spirited
imp!&rdquo; said Tom, lighting up immediately at Philip&rsquo;s fire.
&ldquo;You know I won&rsquo;t hit you, because you&rsquo;re no better than a
girl. But I&rsquo;m an honest man&rsquo;s son, and <i>your</i> father&rsquo;s a
rogue; everybody says so!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom flung out of the room, and slammed the door after him, made strangely
heedless by his anger; for to slam doors within the hearing of Mrs Stelling,
who was probably not far off, was an offence only to be wiped out by twenty
lines of Virgil. In fact, that lady did presently descend from her room, in
double wonder at the noise and the subsequent cessation of Philip&rsquo;s
music. She found him sitting in a heap on the hassock, and crying bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Wakem? what was that noise about? Who slammed
the door?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked up, and hastily dried his eyes. &ldquo;It was Tulliver who came
in&mdash;to ask me to go out with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what are you in trouble about?&rdquo; said Mrs Stelling.
</p>

<p>
Philip was not her favourite of the two pupils; he was less obliging than Tom,
who was made useful in many ways. Still, his father paid more than Mr Tulliver
did, and she meant him to feel that she behaved exceedingly well to him.
Philip, however, met her advances toward a good understanding very much as a
caressed mollusk meets an invitation to show himself out of his shell. Mrs
Stelling was not a loving, tender-hearted woman; she was a woman whose skirt
sat well, who adjusted her waist and patted her curls with a preoccupied air
when she inquired after your welfare. These things, doubtless, represent a
great social power, but it is not the power of love; and no other power could
win Philip from his personal reserve.
</p>

<p>
He said, in answer to her question, &ldquo;My toothache came on, and made me
hysterical again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This had been the fact once, and Philip was glad of the recollection; it was
like an inspiration to enable him to excuse his crying. He had to accept
eau-de-Cologne and to refuse creosote in consequence; but that was easy.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Tom, who had for the first time sent a poisoned arrow into
Philip&rsquo;s heart, had returned to the carriage-house, where he found Mr
Poulter, with a fixed and earnest eye, wasting the perfections of his
sword-exercise on probably observant but inappreciative rats. But Mr Poulter
was a host in himself; that is to say, he admired himself more than a whole
army of spectators could have admired him. He took no notice of Tom&rsquo;s
return, being too entirely absorbed in the cut and thrust,&mdash;the solemn
one, two, three, four; and Tom, not without a slight feeling of alarm at Mr
Poulter&rsquo;s fixed eye and hungry-looking sword, which seemed impatient for
something else to cut besides the air, admired the performance from as great a
distance as possible. It was not until Mr Poulter paused and wiped the
perspiration from his forehead, that Tom felt the full charm of the
sword-exercise, and wished it to be repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Poulter,&rdquo; said Tom, when the sword was being finally sheathed,
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d lend me your sword a little while to keep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No no, young gentleman,&rdquo; said Mr Poulter, shaking his head
decidedly; &ldquo;you might do yourself some mischief with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure I wouldn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d take care
and not hurt myself. I shouldn&rsquo;t take it out of the sheath much, but I
could ground arms with it, and all that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, it won&rsquo;t do, I tell you; it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said
Mr Poulter, preparing to depart. &ldquo;What &rsquo;ud Mr Stelling say to
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I say, do, Mr Poulter! I&rsquo;d give you my five-shilling piece if
you&rsquo;d let me keep the sword a week. Look here!&rdquo; said Tom, reaching
out the attractively large round of silver. The young dog calculated the effect
as well as if he had been a philosopher.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr Poulter, with still deeper gravity, &ldquo;you
must keep it out of sight, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ll keep it under the bed,&rdquo; said Tom, eagerly,
&ldquo;or else at the bottom of my large box.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And let me see, now, whether you can draw it out of the sheath without
hurting yourself.&rdquo; That process having been gone through more than once,
Mr Poulter felt that he had acted with scrupulous conscientiousness, and said,
&ldquo;Well, now, Master Tulliver, if I take the crown-piece, it is to make
sure as you&rsquo;ll do no mischief with the sword.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, indeed, Mr Poulter,&rdquo; said Tom, delightedly handing him the
crown-piece, and grasping the sword, which, he thought, might have been lighter
with advantage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if Mr Stelling catches you carrying it in?&rdquo; said Mr Poulter,
pocketing the crown-piece provisionally while he raised this new doubt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he always keeps in his upstairs study on Saturday afternoon,&rdquo;
said Tom, who disliked anything sneaking, but was not disinclined to a little
stratagem in a worthy cause. So he carried off the sword in triumph mixed with
dread&mdash;dread that he might encounter Mr or Mrs Stelling&mdash;to his
bedroom, where, after some consideration, he hid it in the closet behind some
hanging clothes. That night he fell asleep in the thought that he would
astonish Maggie with it when she came,&mdash;tie it round his waist with his
red comforter, and make her believe that the sword was his own, and that he was
going to be a soldier. There was nobody but Maggie who would be silly enough to
believe him, or whom he dared allow to know he had a sword; and Maggie was
really coming next week to see Tom, before she went to a boarding-school with
Lucy.
</p>

<p>
If you think a lad of thirteen would have been so childish, you must be an
exceptionally wise man, who, although you are devoted to a civil calling,
requiring you to look bland rather than formidable, yet never, since you had a
beard, threw yourself into a martial attitude, and frowned before the
looking-glass. It is doubtful whether our soldiers would be maintained if there
were not pacific people at home who like to fancy themselves soldiers. War,
like other dramatic spectacles, might possibly cease for want of a
&ldquo;public.&rdquo;

Maggie&rsquo;s Second Visit</h3>

<p>
This last breach between the two lads was not readily mended, and for some time
they spoke to each other no more than was necessary. Their natural antipathy of
temperament made resentment an easy passage to hatred, and in Philip the
transition seemed to have begun; there was no malignity in his disposition, but
there was a susceptibility that made him peculiarly liable to a strong sense of
repulsion. The ox&mdash;we may venture to assert it on the authority of a great
classic&mdash;is not given to use his teeth as an instrument of attack, and Tom
was an excellent bovine lad, who ran at questionable objects in a truly
ingenious bovine manner; but he had blundered on Philip&rsquo;s tenderest
point, and had caused him as much acute pain as if he had studied the means
with the nicest precision and the most envenomed spite. Tom saw no reason why
they should not make up this quarrel as they had done many others, by behaving
as if nothing had happened; for though he had never before said to Philip that
his father was a rogue, this idea had so habitually made part of his feeling as
to the relation between himself and his dubious schoolfellow, who he could
neither like nor dislike, that the mere utterance did not make such an epoch to
him as it did to Philip. And he had a right to say so when Philip hectored over
<i>him</i>, and called him names. But perceiving that his first advances toward
amity were not met, he relapsed into his least favourable disposition toward
Philip, and resolved never to appeal to him either about drawing or exercise
again. They were only so far civil to each other as was necessary to prevent
their state of feud from being observed by Mr Stelling, who would have
&ldquo;put down&rdquo; such nonsense with great vigor.
</p>

<p>
When Maggie came, however, she could not help looking with growing interest at
the new schoolfellow, although he was the son of that wicked Lawyer Wakem, who
made her father so angry. She had arrived in the middle of school-hours, and
had sat by while Philip went through his lessons with Mr Stelling. Tom, some
weeks ago, had sent her word that Philip knew no end of stories,&mdash;not
stupid stories like hers; and she was convinced now from her own observation
that he must be very clever; she hoped he would think <i>her</i> rather clever
too, when she came to talk to him. Maggie, moreover, had rather a tenderness
for deformed things; she preferred the wry-necked lambs, because it seemed to
her that the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldn&rsquo;t mind so
much about being petted; and she was especially fond of petting objects that
would think it very delightful to be petted by her. She loved Tom very dearly,
but she often wished that he <i>cared</i> more about her loving him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think Philip Wakem seems a nice boy, Tom,&rdquo; she said, when they
went out of the study together into the garden, to pass the interval before
dinner. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t choose his father, you know; and I&rsquo;ve
read of very bad men who had good sons, as well as good parents who had bad
children. And if Philip is good, I think we ought to be the more sorry for him
because his father is not a good man. <i>You</i> like him, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a queer fellow,&rdquo; said Tom, curtly, &ldquo;and
he&rsquo;s as sulky as can be with me, because I told him his father was a
rogue. And I&rsquo;d a right to tell him so, for it was true; and <i>he</i>
began it, with calling me names. But you stop here by yourself a bit, Maggie,
will you? I&rsquo;ve got something I want to do upstairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go too?&rdquo; said Maggie, who in this first day of
meeting again loved Tom&rsquo;s shadow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll tell you about by-and-by, not
yet,&rdquo; said Tom, skipping away.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study, preparing the
morrow&rsquo;s lesson&rsquo;s that they might have a holiday in the evening in
honour of Maggie&rsquo;s arrival. Tom was hanging over his Latin grammar,
moving his lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient Catholic repeating his
tale of paternosters; and Philip, at the other end of the room, was busy with
two volumes, with a look of contented diligence that excited Maggie&rsquo;s
curiosity; he did not look at all as if he were learning a lesson. She sat on a
low stool at nearly a right angle with the two boys, watching first one and
then the other; and Philip, looking off his book once toward the fire-place,
caught the pair of questioning dark eyes fixed upon him. He thought this sister
of Tulliver&rsquo;s seemed a nice little thing, quite unlike her brother; he
wished <i>he</i> had a little sister. What was it, he wondered, that made
Maggie&rsquo;s dark eyes remind him of the stories about princesses being
turned into animals? I think it was that her eyes were full of unsatisfied
intelligence, and unsatisfied beseeching affection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Magsie,&rdquo; said Tom at last, shutting his books and putting
them away with the energy and decision of a perfect master in the art of
leaving off, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my lessons now. Come upstairs with
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Maggie, when they were outside the door, a
slight suspicion crossing her mind as she remembered Tom&rsquo;s preliminary
visit upstairs. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a trick you&rsquo;re going to play me,
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom, in his most coaxing tone;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll like <i>ever so</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his arm round her neck, and she put hers round his waist, and twined
together in this way, they went upstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Magsie, you must not tell anybody, you know,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;else I shall get fifty lines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it alive?&rdquo; said Maggie, whose imagination had settled for the
moment on the idea that Tom kept a ferret clandestinely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now you go
into that corner and hide your face, while I reach it out,&rdquo; he added, as
he locked the bedroom door behind them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when to turn
round. You mustn&rsquo;t squeal out, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but if you frighten me, I shall,&rdquo; said Maggie, beginning to
look rather serious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be frightened, you silly thing,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;Go and hide your face, and mind you don&rsquo;t peep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t peep,&rdquo; said Maggie, disdainfully;
and she buried her face in the pillow like a person of strict honour.
</p>

<p>
But Tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet; then he stepped into
the narrow space, and almost closed the door. Maggie kept her face buried
without the aid of principle, for in that dream-suggestive attitude she had
soon forgotten where she was, and her thoughts were busy with the poor deformed
boy, who was so clever, when Tom called out, &ldquo;Now then, Magsie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects could have
enabled Tom to present so striking a figure as he did to Maggie when she looked
up. Dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a face which had no more than the
faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow, together with a pair of amiable blue-gray eyes
and round pink cheeks that refused to look formidable, let him frown as he
would before the looking-glass (Philip had once told him of a man who had a
horseshoe frown, and Tom had tried with all his frowning might to make a
horseshoe on his forehead), he had had recourse to that unfailing source of the
terrible, burnt cork, and had made himself a pair of black eyebrows that met in
a satisfactory manner over his nose, and were matched by a less carefully
adjusted blackness about the chin. He had wound a red handkerchief round his
cloth cap to give it the air of a turban, and his red comforter across his
breast as a scarf,&mdash;an amount of red which, with the tremendous frown on
his brow, and the decision with which he grasped the sword, as he held it with
its point resting on the ground, would suffice to convey an approximate idea of
his fierce and bloodthirsty disposition.
</p>

<p>
Maggie looked bewildered for a moment, and Tom enjoyed that moment keenly; but
in the next she laughed, clapped her hands together, and said, &ldquo;Oh, Tom,
you&rsquo;ve made yourself like Bluebeard at the show.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the sword,&mdash;it
was not unsheathed. Her frivolous mind required a more direct appeal to its
sense of the terrible, and Tom prepared for his master-stroke. Frowning with a
double amount of intention, if not of corrugation, he (carefully) drew the
sword from its sheath, and pointed it at Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Maggie, in a tone of
suppressed dread, shrinking away from him into the opposite corner. &ldquo;I
<i>shall</i> scream&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I shall! Oh, don&rsquo;t I wish
I&rsquo;d never come upstairs!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The corners of Tom&rsquo;s mouth showed an inclination to a smile of
complacency that was immediately checked as inconsistent with the severity of a
great warrior. Slowly he let down the scabbard on the floor, lest it should
make too much noise, and then said sternly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Duke of Wellington! March!&rdquo; stamping forward with
the right leg a little bent, and the sword still pointing toward Maggie, who,
trembling, and with tear-filled eyes, got upon the bed, as the only means of
widening the space between them.
</p>

<p>
Tom, happy in this spectator of his military performances, even though the
spectator was only Maggie, proceeded, with the utmost exertion of his force, to
such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would necessarily be expected of
the Duke of Wellington.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom, I <i>will not</i> bear it, I <i>will</i> scream,&rdquo; said
Maggie, at the first movement of the sword. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hurt yourself;
you&rsquo;ll cut your head off!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One&mdash;two,&rdquo; said Tom, resolutely, though at &ldquo;two&rdquo;
his wrist trembled a little. &ldquo;Three&rdquo; came more slowly, and with it
the sword swung downward, and Maggie gave a loud shriek. The sword had fallen,
with its edge on Tom&rsquo;s foot, and in a moment after he had fallen too.
Maggie leaped from the bed, still shrieking, and immediately there was a rush
of footsteps toward the room. Mr Stelling, from his upstairs study, was the
first to enter. He found both the children on the floor. Tom had fainted, and
Maggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket, screaming, with wild eyes.
She thought he was dead, poor child! and yet she shook him, as if that would
bring him back to life. In another minute she was sobbing with joy because Tom
opened his eyes. She couldn&rsquo;t sorrow yet that he had hurt his foot; it
seemed as if all happiness lay in his being alive.

<h3><a name="chap19"></a>Chapter VI.<br/>
A Love-Scene</h3>

<p>
Poor Tom bore his severe pain heroically, and was resolute in not
&ldquo;telling&rdquo; of Mr Poulter more than was unavoidable; the
five-shilling piece remained a secret even to Maggie. But there was a terrible
dread weighing on his mind, so terrible that he dared not even ask the question
which might bring the fatal &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; he dared not ask the surgeon or
Mr Stelling, &ldquo;Shall I be lame, Sir?&rdquo; He mastered himself so as not
to cry out at the pain; but when his foot had been dressed, and he was left
alone with Maggie seated by his bedside, the children sobbed together, with
their heads laid on the same pillow. Tom was thinking of himself walking about
on crutches, like the wheelwright&rsquo;s son; and Maggie, who did not guess
what was in his mind, sobbed for company. It had not occurred to the surgeon or
to Mr Stelling to anticipate this dread in Tom&rsquo;s mind, and to reassure
him by hopeful words. But Philip watched the surgeon out of the house, and
waylaid Mr Stelling to ask the very question that Tom had not dared to ask for
himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&mdash;but does Mr Askern say Tulliver will be
lame?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no; oh, no,&rdquo; said Mr Stelling, &ldquo;not permanently; only
for a little while.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he tell Tulliver so, sir, do you think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; nothing was said to him on the subject.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then may I go and tell him, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, to be sure; now you mention it, I dare say he may be troubling
about that. Go to his bedroom, but be very quiet at present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It had been Philip&rsquo;s first thought when he heard of the
accident,&mdash;&ldquo;Will Tulliver be lame? It will be very hard for him if
he is&rdquo;; and Tom&rsquo;s hitherto unforgiven offences were washed out by
that pity. Philip felt that they were no longer in a state of repulsion, but
were being drawn into a common current of suffering and sad privation. His
imagination did not dwell on the outward calamity and its future effect on
Tom&rsquo;s life, but it made vividly present to him the probable state of
Tom&rsquo;s feeling. Philip had only lived fourteen years, but those years had,
most of them, been steeped in the sense of a lot irremediably hard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Askern says you&rsquo;ll soon be all right again, Tulliver, did you
know?&rdquo; he said rather timidly, as he stepped gently up to Tom&rsquo;s
bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been to ask Mr Stelling, and he says you&rsquo;ll
walk as well as ever again by-and-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes with a
sudden joy; then he gave a long sigh, and turned his blue-gray eyes straight on
Philip&rsquo;s face, as he had not done for a fortnight or more. As for Maggie,
this intimation of a possibility she had not thought of before affected her as
a new trouble; the bare idea of Tom&rsquo;s being always lame overpowered the
assurance that such a misfortune was not likely to befall him, and she clung to
him and cried afresh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a little silly, Magsie,&rdquo; said Tom, tenderly,
feeling very brave now. &ldquo;I shall soon get well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-by, Tulliver,&rdquo; said Philip, putting out his small, delicate
hand, which Tom clasped immediately with his more substantial fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;ask Mr Stelling to let you come and sit
with me sometimes, till I get up again, Wakem; and tell me about Robert Bruce,
you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After that, Philip spent all his time out of school-hours with Tom and Maggie.
Tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever, but he insisted strongly on
the fact that those great fighters who did so many wonderful things and came
off unhurt, wore excellent armor from head to foot, which made fighting easy
work, he considered. He should not have hurt his foot if he had had an iron
shoe on. He listened with great interest to a new story of Philip&rsquo;s about
a man who had a very bad wound in his foot, and cried out so dreadfully with
the pain that his friends could bear with him no longer, but put him ashore on
a desert island, with nothing but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill
animals with for food.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t roar out a bit, you know,&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;and I
dare say my foot was as bad as his. It&rsquo;s cowardly to roar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Maggie would have it that when anything hurt you very much, it was quite
permissible to cry out, and it was cruel of people not to bear it. She wanted
to know if Philoctetes had a sister, and why <i>she</i> didn&rsquo;t go with
him on the desert island and take care of him.
</p>

<p>
One day, soon after Philip had told this story, he and Maggie were in the study
alone together while Tom&rsquo;s foot was being dressed. Philip was at his
books, and Maggie, after sauntering idly round the room, not caring to do
anything in particular, because she would soon go to Tom again, went and leaned
on the table near Philip to see what he was doing, for they were quite old
friends now, and perfectly at home with each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you reading about in Greek?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
poetry, I can see that, because the lines are so short.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Philoctetes, the lame man I was telling you of
yesterday,&rdquo; he answered, resting his head on his hand, and looking at her
as if he were not at all sorry to be interrupted. Maggie, in her absent way,
continued to lean forward, resting on her arms and moving her feet about, while
her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if she had quite forgotten
Philip and his book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, after a minute or two, still leaning on his
elbow and looking at her, &ldquo;if you had had a brother like me, do you think
you should have loved him as well as Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie started a little on being roused from her reverie, and said,
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Philip repeated his question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, better,&rdquo; she answered immediately. &ldquo;No, not better;
because I don&rsquo;t think I <i>could</i> love you better than Tom. But I
should be so sorry,&mdash;<i>so sorry</i> for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip coloured; he had meant to imply, would she love him as well in spite of
his deformity, and yet when she alluded to it so plainly, he winced under her
pity. Maggie, young as she was, felt her mistake. Hitherto she had
instinctively behaved as if she were quite unconscious of Philip&rsquo;s
deformity; her own keen sensitiveness and experience under family criticism
sufficed to teach her this as well as if she had been directed by the most
finished breeding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you are so very clever, Philip, and you can play and sing,&rdquo;
she added quickly. &ldquo;I wish you <i>were</i> my brother. I&rsquo;m very
fond of you. And you would stay at home with me when Tom went out, and you
would teach me everything; wouldn&rsquo;t you,&mdash;Greek and
everything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll go away soon, and go to school, Maggie,&rdquo; said
Philip, &ldquo;and then you&rsquo;ll forget all about me, and not care for me
any more. And then I shall see you when you&rsquo;re grown up, and you&rsquo;ll
hardly take any notice of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said
Maggie, shaking her head very seriously. &ldquo;I never forget anything, and I
think about everybody when I&rsquo;m away from them. I think about poor Yap;
he&rsquo;s got a lump in his throat, and Luke says he&rsquo;ll die. Only
don&rsquo;t you tell Tom. because it will vex him so. You never saw Yap;
he&rsquo;s a queer little dog,&mdash;nobody cares about him but Tom and
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you care as much about me as you do about Yap, Maggie?&rdquo; said
Philip, smiling rather sadly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I should think so,&rdquo; said Maggie, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of <i>you</i>, Maggie; I shall never forget
<i>you</i>,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;and when I&rsquo;m very unhappy, I shall
always think of you, and wish I had a sister with dark eyes, just like
yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you like my eyes?&rdquo; said Maggie, well pleased. She had never
heard any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not like
any other eyes. They seem trying to speak,&mdash;trying to speak kindly. I
don&rsquo;t like other people to look at me much, but I like you to look at me,
Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I think you&rsquo;re fonder of me than Tom is,&rdquo; said Maggie,
rather sorrowfully. Then, wondering how she could convince Philip that she
could like him just as well, although he was crooked, she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Should you like me to kiss you, as I do Tom? I will, if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very much; nobody kisses me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him quite earnestly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall always remember you, and kiss
you when I see you again, if it&rsquo;s ever so long. But I&rsquo;ll go now,
because I think Mr Askern&rsquo;s done with Tom&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When their father came the second time, Maggie said to him, &ldquo;Oh, father,
Philip Wakem is so very good to Tom; he is such a clever boy, and I <i>do</i>
love him. And you love him too, Tom, don&rsquo;t you? <i>Say</i> you love
him,&rdquo; she added entreatingly.
</p>

<p>
Tom coloured a little as he looked at his father, and said: &ldquo;I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be friends with him when I leave school, father; but
we&rsquo;ve made it up now, since my foot has been bad, and he&rsquo;s taught
me to play at draughts, and I can beat him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s good to you,
try and make him amends, and be good to <i>him</i>. He&rsquo;s a poor crooked
creature, and takes after his dead mother. But don&rsquo;t you be getting too
thick with him; he&rsquo;s got his father&rsquo;s blood in him too. Ay, ay, the
gray colt may chance to kick like his black sire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The jarring natures of the two boys effected what Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s
admonition alone might have failed to effect; in spite of Philip&rsquo;s new
kindness, and Tom&rsquo;s answering regard in this time of his trouble, they
never became close friends. When Maggie was gone, and when Tom by-and-by began
to walk about as usual, the friendly warmth that had been kindled by pity and
gratitude died out by degrees, and left them in their old relation to each
other. Philip was often peevish and contemptuous; and Tom&rsquo;s more specific
and kindly impressions gradually melted into the old background of suspicion
and dislike toward him as a queer fellow, a humpback, and the son of a rogue.
If boys and men are to be welded together in the glow of transient feeling,
they must be made of metal that will mix, else they inevitably fall asunder
when the heat dies out.

The Golden Gates Are Passed</h3>

<p>
So Tom went on even to the fifth half-year&mdash;till he was turned
sixteen&mdash;at King&rsquo;s Lorton, while Maggie was growing with a rapidity
which her aunts considered highly reprehensible, at Miss Firniss&rsquo;s
boarding-school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss, with cousin Lucy
for her companion. In her early letters to Tom she had always sent her love to
Philip, and asked many questions about him, which were answered by brief
sentences about Tom&rsquo;s toothache, and a turf-house which he was helping to
build in the garden, with other items of that kind. She was pained to hear Tom
say in the holidays that Philip was as queer as ever again, and often cross.
They were no longer very good friends, she perceived; and when she reminded Tom
that he ought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was
bad, he answered: &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t my fault; <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t do
anything to him.&rdquo; She hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of
their school-life; in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the seaside,
and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in the street of St
Ogg&rsquo;s. When they did meet, she remembered her promise to kiss him, but,
as a young lady who had been at a boarding-school, she knew now that such a
greeting was out of the question, and Philip would not expect it. The promise
was void, like so many other sweet, illusory promises of our childhood; void as
promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided, and when the starry
blossoms grew side by side with the ripening peach,&mdash;impossible to be
fulfilled when the golden gates had been passed.
</p>

<p>
But when their father was actually engaged in the long-threatened lawsuit, and
Wakem, as the agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry, was acting against him,
even Maggie felt, with some sadness, that they were not likely ever to have any
intimacy with Philip again; the very name of Wakem made her father angry, and
she had once heard him say that if that crook-backed son lived to inherit his
father&rsquo;s ill-gotten gains, there would be a curse upon him. &ldquo;Have
as little to do with him at school as you can, my lad,&rdquo; he said to Tom;
and the command was obeyed the more easily because Mr Sterling by this time
had two additional pupils; for though this gentleman&rsquo;s rise in the world
was not of that meteor-like rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous
eloquence had expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere, he
had yet enough of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his expenditure
in continued disproportion to his income.
</p>

<p>
As for Tom&rsquo;s school course, it went on with mill-like monotony, his mind
continuing to move with a slow, half-stifled pulse in a medium uninteresting or
unintelligible ideas. But each vacation he brought home larger and larger
drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape, and water-colours in vivid
greens, together with manuscript books full of exercises and problems, in which
the handwriting was all the finer because he gave his whole mind to it. Each
vacation he brought home a new book or two, indicating his progress through
different stages of history, Christian doctrine, and Latin literature; and that
passage was not entirely without results, besides the possession of the books.
Tom&rsquo;s ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great many words and
phrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition; and though
he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons, the lessons had
left a deposit of vague, fragmentary, ineffectual notions. Mr Tulliver, seeing
signs of acquirement beyond the reach of his own criticism, thought it was
probably all right with Tom&rsquo;s education; he observed, indeed, that there
were no maps, and not enough &ldquo;summing&rdquo;; but he made no formal
complaint to Mr Stelling. It was a puzzling business, this schooling; and if
he took Tom away, where could he send him with better effect?
</p>

<p>
By the time Tom had reached his last quarter at King&rsquo;s Lorton, the years
had made striking changes in him since the day we saw him returning from Mr
Jacobs&rsquo;s academy. He was a tall youth now, carrying himself without the
least awkwardness, and speaking without more shyness than was a becoming
symptom of blended diffidence and pride; he wore his tail-coat and his stand-up
collars, and watched the down on his lip with eager impatience, looking every
day at his virgin razor, with which he had provided himself in the last
holidays. Philip had already left,&mdash;at the autumn quarter,&mdash;that he
might go to the south for the winter, for the sake of his health; and this
change helped to give Tom the unsettled, exultant feeling that usually belongs
to the last months before leaving school. This quarter, too, there was some
hope of his father&rsquo;s lawsuit being decided; <i>that</i> made the prospect
of home more entirely pleasurable. For Tom, who had gathered his view of the
case from his father&rsquo;s conversation, had no doubt that Pivart would be
beaten.
</p>

<p>
Tom had not heard anything from home for some weeks,&mdash;a fact which did not
surprise him, for his father and mother were not apt to manifest their
affection in unnecessary letters,&mdash;when, to his great surprise, on the
morning of a dark, cold day near the end of November, he was told, soon after
entering the study at nine o&rsquo;clock, that his sister was in the
drawing-room. It was Mrs Stelling who had come into the study to tell him, and
she left him to enter the drawing-room alone.
</p>

<p>
Maggie, too, was tall now, with braided and coiled hair; she was almost as tall
as Tom, though she was only thirteen; and she really looked older than he did
at that moment. She had thrown off her bonnet, her heavy braids were pushed
back from her forehead, as if it would not bear that extra load, and her young
face had a strangely worn look, as her eyes turned anxiously toward the door.
When Tom entered she did not speak, but only went up to him, put her arms round
his neck, and kissed him earnestly. He was used to various moods of hers, and
felt no alarm at the unusual seriousness of her greeting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, how is it you&rsquo;re come so early this cold morning, Maggie? Did
you come in the gig?&rdquo; said Tom, as she backed toward the sofa, and drew
him to her side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I came by the coach. I&rsquo;ve walked from the turnpike.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how is it you&rsquo;re not at school? The holidays have not begun
yet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father wanted me at home,&rdquo; said Maggie, with a slight trembling of
the lip. &ldquo;I came home three or four days ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t my father well?&rdquo; said Tom, rather anxiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very unhappy, Tom. The
lawsuit is ended, and I came to tell you because I thought it would be better
for you to know it before you came home, and I didn&rsquo;t like only to send
you a letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father hasn&rsquo;t lost?&rdquo; said Tom, hastily, springing from
the sofa, and standing before Maggie with his hands suddenly thrust into his
pockets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, looking up at him with trembling.
</p>

<p>
Tom was silent a minute or two, with his eyes fixed on the floor. Then he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father will have to pay a good deal of money, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maggie, rather faintly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; said Tom, bravely, not
translating the loss of a large sum of money into any tangible results.
&ldquo;But my father&rsquo;s very much vexed, I dare say?&rdquo; he added,
looking at Maggie, and thinking that her agitated face was only part of her
girlish way of taking things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maggie, again faintly. Then, urged to fuller speech by
Tom&rsquo;s freedom from apprehension, she said loudly and rapidly, as if the
words <i>would</i> burst from her: &ldquo;Oh, Tom, he will lose the mill and
the land and everything; he will have nothing left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom&rsquo;s eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her, before he turned
pale, and trembled visibly. He said nothing, but sat down on the sofa again,
looking vaguely out of the opposite window.
</p>

<p>
Anxiety about the future had never entered Tom&rsquo;s mind. His father had
always ridden a good horse, kept a good house, and had the cheerful, confident
air of a man who has plenty of property to fall back upon. Tom had never
dreamed that his father would &ldquo;fail&rdquo;; <i>that</i> was a form of
misfortune which he had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace, and disgrace
was an idea that he could not associate with any of his relations, least of all
with his father. A proud sense of family respectability was part of the very
air Tom had been born and brought up in. He knew there were people in St
Ogg&rsquo;s who made a show without money to support it, and he had always
heard such people spoken of by his own friends with contempt and reprobation.
He had a strong belief, which was a lifelong habit, and required no definite
evidence to rest on, that his father could spend a great deal of money if he
chose; and since his education at Mr Stelling&rsquo;s had given him a more
expensive view of life, he had often thought that when he got older he would
make a figure in the world, with his horse and dogs and saddle, and other
accoutrements of a fine young man, and show himself equal to any of his
contemporaries at St Ogg&rsquo;s, who might consider themselves a grade above
him in society because their fathers were professional men, or had large
oil-mills. As to the prognostics and headshaking of his aunts and uncles, they
had never produced the least effect on him, except to make him think that aunts
and uncles were disagreeable society; he had heard them find fault in much the
same way as long as he could remember. His father knew better than they did.
</p>

<p>
The down had come on Tom&rsquo;s lip, yet his thoughts and expectations had
been hitherto only the reproduction, in changed forms, of the boyish dreams in
which he had lived three years ago. He was awakened now with a violent shock.
</p>

<p>
Maggie was frightened at Tom&rsquo;s pale, trembling silence. There was
something else to tell him,&mdash;something worse. She threw her arms round him
at last, and said, with a half sob:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom&mdash;dear, dear Tom, don&rsquo;t fret too much; try and bear it
well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom turned his cheek passively to meet her entreating kisses, and there
gathered a moisture in his eyes, which he just rubbed away with his hand. The
action seemed to rouse him, for he shook himself and said: &ldquo;I shall go
home, with you, Maggie. Didn&rsquo;t my father say I was to go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Tom, father didn&rsquo;t wish it,&rdquo; said Maggie, her anxiety
about <i>his</i> feeling helping her to master her agitation. What <i>would</i>
he do when she told him all? &ldquo;But mother wants you to come,&mdash;poor
mother!&mdash;she cries so. Oh, Tom, it&rsquo;s very dreadful at home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s lips grew whiter, and she began to tremble almost as Tom had
done. The two poor things clung closer to each other, both trembling,&mdash;the
one at an unshapen fear, the other at the image of a terrible certainty. When
Maggie spoke, it was hardly above a whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;poor father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie could not utter it. But the suspense was intolerable to Tom. A vague
idea of going to prison, as a consequence of debt, was the shape his fears had
begun to take.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my father?&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;<i>Tell</i>
me, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at home,&rdquo; said Maggie, finding it easier to reply to
that question. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, after a pause, &ldquo;not
himself&mdash;he fell off his horse. He has known nobody but me ever
since&mdash;he seems to have lost his senses. O father,
father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these last words, Maggie&rsquo;s sobs burst forth with the more violence
for the previous struggle against them. Tom felt that pressure of the heart
which forbids tears; he had no distinct vision of their troubles as Maggie had,
who had been at home; he only felt the crushing weight of what seemed
unmitigated misfortune. He tightened his arm almost convulsively round Maggie
as she sobbed, but his face looked rigid and tearless, his eyes blank,&mdash;as
if a black curtain of cloud had suddenly fallen on his path.
</p>

<p>
But Maggie soon checked herself abruptly; a single thought had acted on her
like a startling sound.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must set out, Tom, we must not stay. Father will miss me; we must be
at the turnpike at ten to meet the coach.&rdquo; She said this with hasty
decision, rubbing her eyes, and rising to seize her bonnet.
</p>

<p>
Tom at once felt the same impulse, and rose too. &ldquo;Wait a minute,
Maggie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must speak to Mr Stelling, and then
we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought he must go to the study where the pupils were; but on his way he met
Mr Stelling, who had heard from his wife that Maggie appeared to be in trouble
when she asked for her brother, and now that he thought the brother and sister
had been alone long enough, was coming to inquire and offer his sympathy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, sir, I must go home,&rdquo; Tom said abruptly, as he met Mr
Stelling in the passage. &ldquo;I must go back with my sister directly. My
father&rsquo;s lost his lawsuit&mdash;he&rsquo;s lost all his
property&mdash;and he&rsquo;s very ill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Stelling felt like a kind-hearted man; he foresaw a probable money loss for
himself, but this had no appreciable share in his feeling, while he looked with
grave pity at the brother and sister for whom youth and sorrow had begun
together. When he knew how Maggie had come, and how eager she was to get home
again, he hurried their departure, only whispering something to Mrs Stelling,
who had followed him, and who immediately left the room.
</p>

<p>
Tom and Maggie were standing on the door-step, ready to set out, when Mrs
Stelling came with a little basket, which she hung on Maggie&rsquo;s arm,
saying: &ldquo;Do remember to eat something on the way, dear.&rdquo;
Maggie&rsquo;s heart went out toward this woman whom she had never liked, and
she kissed her silently. It was the first sign within the poor child of that
new sense which is the gift of sorrow,&mdash;that susceptibility to the bare
offices of humanity which raises them into a bond of loving fellowship, as to
haggard men among the ice-bergs the mere presence of an ordinary comrade stirs
the deep fountains of affection.
</p>

<p>
Mr Stelling put his hand on Tom&rsquo;s shoulder and said: &ldquo;God bless
you, my boy; let me know how you get on.&rdquo; Then he pressed Maggie&rsquo;s
hand; but there were no audible good-byes. Tom had so often thought how joyful
he should be the day he left school &ldquo;for good&rdquo;! And now his school
years seemed like a holiday that had come to an end.
</p>

<p>
The two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant
road,&mdash;were soon lost behind the projecting hedgerow.
</p>

<p>
They had gone forth together into their life of sorrow, and they would never
more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares. They had entered the thorny
wilderness, and the golden gates of their childhood had forever closed behind
them.

What Had Happened at Home</h3>

<p>
When Mr Tulliver first knew the fact that the lawsuit was decided against him,
and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant, every one who happened to observe
him at the time thought that, for so confident and hot-tempered a man, he bore
the blow remarkably well. He thought so himself; he thought he was going to
show that if Wakem or anybody else considered him crushed, they would find
themselves mistaken. He could not refuse to see that the costs of this
protracted suit would take more than he possessed to pay them; but he appeared
to himself to be full of expedients by which he could ward off any results but
such as were tolerable, and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the
world. All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature, driven out of their old
channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate formation of plans by
which he would meet his difficulties, and remain Mr Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill
in spite of them. There was such a rush of projects in his brain, that it was
no wonder his face was flushed when he came away from his talk with his
attorney, Mr Gore, and mounted his horse to ride home from Lindum. There was
Furley, who held the mortgage on the land,&mdash;a reasonable fellow, who would
see his own interest, Mr Tulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not
only to purchase the whole estate, including the mill and homestead, but would
accept Mr Tulliver as tenant, and be willing to advance money to be repaid
with high interest out of the profits of the business, which would be made over
to him, Mr Tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself and his
family. Who would neglect such a profitable investment? Certainly not Furley,
for Mr Tulliver had determined that Furley should meet his plans with the
utmost alacrity; and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously
heated by the loss of a lawsuit, who are apt to see in their own interest or
desires a motive for other men&rsquo;s actions. There was no doubt (in the
miller&rsquo;s mind) that Furley would do just what was desirable; and if he
did&mdash;why, things would not be so very much worse. Mr Tulliver and his
family must live more meagrely and humbly, but it would only be till the
profits of the business had paid off Furley&rsquo;s advances, and that might be
while Mr Tulliver had still a good many years of life before him. It was clear
that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to turn out
of his old place, and look like a ruined man. It was certainly an awkward
moment in his affairs. There was that suretyship for poor Riley, who had died
suddenly last April, and left his friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and
fifty pounds,&mdash;a fact which had helped to make Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s
banking book less pleasant reading than a man might desire toward Christmas.
Well! he had never been one of those poor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to
give a helping hand to a fellow-traveller in this puzzling world. The really
vexatious business was the fact that some months ago the creditor who had lent
him the five hundred pounds to repay Mrs Glegg had become uneasy about his
money (set on by Wakem, of course), and Mr Tulliver, still confident that he
should gain his suit, and finding it eminently inconvenient to raise the said
sum until that desirable issue had taken place, had rashly acceded to the
demand that he should give a bill of sale on his household furniture and some
other effects, as security in lieu of the bond. It was all one, he had said to
himself; he should soon pay off the money, and there was no harm in giving that
security any more than another. But now the consequences of this bill of sale
occurred to him in a new light, and he remembered that the time was close at
hand when it would be enforced unless the money were repaid. Two months ago he
would have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his wife&rsquo;s
friends; but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing but right and
natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain the thing to them; they
would hardly let Bessy&rsquo;s furniture be sold, and it might be security to
Pullet if he advanced the money,&mdash;there would, after all, be no gift or
favour in the matter. Mr Tulliver would never have asked for anything from so
poor-spirited a fellow for himself, but Bessy might do so if she liked.
</p>

<p>
It is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most liable to
shift their position and contradict themselves in this sudden manner;
everything is easier to them than to face the simple fact that they have been
thoroughly defeated, and must begin life anew. And Mr Tulliver, you perceive,
though nothing more than a superior miller and maltster, was as proud and
obstinate as if he had been a very lofty personage, in whom such dispositions
might be a source of that conspicuous, far-echoing tragedy, which sweeps the
stage in regal robes, and makes the dullest chronicler sublime. The pride and
obstinacy of millers and other insignificant people, whom you pass unnoticingly
on the road every day, have their tragedy too; but it is of that unwept, hidden
sort that goes on from generation to generation, and leaves no
record,&mdash;such tragedy, perhaps, as lies in the conflicts of young souls,
hungry for joy, under a lot made suddenly hard to them, under the dreariness of
a home where the morning brings no promise with it, and where the unexpectant
discontent of worn and disappointed parents weighs on the children like a damp,
thick air, in which all the functions of life are depressed; or such tragedy as
lies in the slow or sudden death that follows on a bruised passion, though it
may be a death that finds only a parish funeral. There are certain animals to
which tenacity of position is a law of life,&mdash;they can never flourish
again, after a single wrench: and there are certain human beings to whom
predominance is a law of life,&mdash;they can only sustain humiliation so long
as they can refuse to believe in it, and, in their own conception, predominate
still.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver was still predominating, in his own imagination, as he approached
St Ogg&rsquo;s, through which he had to pass on his way homeward. But what was
it that suggested to him, as he saw the Laceham coach entering the town, to
follow it to the coach-office, and get the clerk there to write a letter,
requiring Maggie to come home the very next day? Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s own hand
shook too much under his excitement for him to write himself, and he wanted the
letter to be given to the coachman to deliver at Miss Firniss&rsquo;s school in
the morning. There was a craving which he would not account for to himself, to
have Maggie near him, without delay,&mdash;she must come back by the coach
to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
To Mrs Tulliver, when he got home, he would admit no difficulties, and scolded
down her burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost, by angry
assertions that there was nothing to grieve about. He said nothing to her that
night about the bill of sale and the application to Mrs Pullet, for he had
kept her in ignorance of the nature of that transaction, and had explained the
necessity for taking an inventory of the goods as a matter connected with his
will. The possession of a wife conspicuously one&rsquo;s inferior in intellect
is, like other high privileges, attended with a few inconveniences, and, among
the rest, with the occasional necessity for using a little deception.
</p>

<p>
The next day Mr Tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon, on his way
to Mr Gore&rsquo;s office at St Ogg&rsquo;s. Gore was to have seen Furley in
the morning, and to have sounded him in relation to Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s
affairs. But he had not gone half-way when he met a clerk from Mr Gore&rsquo;s
office, who was bringing a letter to Mr Tulliver. Mr Gore had been prevented
by a sudden call of business from waiting at his office to see Mr Tulliver,
according to appointment, but would be at his office at eleven to-morrow
morning, and meanwhile had sent some important information by letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, taking the letter, but not opening it.
&ldquo;Then tell Gore I&rsquo;ll see him to-morrow at eleven&rdquo;; and he
turned his horse.
</p>

<p>
The clerk, struck with Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s glistening, excited glance, looked
after him for a few moments, and then rode away. The reading of a letter was
not the affair of an instant to Mr Tulliver; he took in the sense of a
statement very slowly through the medium of written or even printed characters;
so he had put the letter in his pocket, thinking he would open it in his
armchair at home. But by-and-by it occurred to him that there might be
something in the letter Mrs Tulliver must not know about, and if so, it would
be better to keep it out of her sight altogether. He stopped his horse, took
out the letter, and read it. It was only a short letter; the substance was,
that Mr Gore had ascertained, on secret, but sure authority, that Furley had
been lately much straitened for money, and had parted with his
securities,&mdash;among the rest, the mortgage on Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s
property, which he had transferred to&mdash;&mdash;Wakem.
</p>

<p>
In half an hour after this Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s own wagoner found him lying by
the roadside insensible, with an open letter near him, and his gray horse
snuffing uneasily about him.
</p>

<p>
When Maggie reached home that evening, in obedience to her father&rsquo;s call,
he was no longer insensible. About an hour before he had become conscious, and
after vague, vacant looks around him, had muttered something about &ldquo;a
letter,&rdquo; which he presently repeated impatiently. At the instance of Mr
Turnbull, the medical man, Gore&rsquo;s letter was brought and laid on the bed,
and the previous impatience seemed to be allayed. The stricken man lay for some
time with his eyes fixed on the letter, as if he were trying to knit up his
thoughts by its help. But presently a new wave of memory seemed to have come
and swept the other away; he turned his eyes from the letter to the door, and
after looking uneasily, as if striving to see something his eyes were too dim
for, he said, &ldquo;The little wench.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He repeated the words impatiently from time to time, appearing entirely
unconscious of everything except this one importunate want, and giving no sign
of knowing his wife or any one else; and poor Mrs Tulliver, her feeble
faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden accumulation of troubles, went
backward and forward to the gate to see if the Laceham coach were coming,
though it was not yet time.
</p>

<p>
But it came at last, and set down the poor anxious girl, no longer the
&ldquo;little wench,&rdquo; except to her father&rsquo;s fond memory.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, mother, what is the matter?&rdquo; Maggie said, with pale lips, as
her mother came toward her crying. She didn&rsquo;t think her father was ill,
because the letter had come at his dictation from the office at St
Ogg&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
But Mr Turnbull came now to meet her; a medical man is the good angel of the
troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom she remembered
as long as she could remember anything, with a trembling, questioning look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself too much, my dear,&rdquo; he said, taking her
hand. &ldquo;Your father has had a sudden attack, and has not quite recovered
his memory. But he has been asking for you, and it will do him good to see you.
Keep as quiet as you can; take off your things, and come upstairs with
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie obeyed, with that terrible beating of the heart which makes existence
seem simply a painful pulsation. The very quietness with which Mr Turnbull
spoke had frightened her susceptible imagination. Her father&rsquo;s eyes were
still turned uneasily toward the door when she entered and met the strange,
yearning, helpless look that had been seeking her in vain. With a sudden flash
and movement, he raised himself in the bed; she rushed toward him, and clasped
him with agonised kisses.
</p>

<p>
Poor child! it was very early for her to know one of those supreme moments in
life when all we have hoped or delighted in, all we can dread or endure, falls
away from our regard as insignificant; is lost, like a trivial memory, in that
simple, primitive love which knits us to the beings who have been nearest to
us, in their times of helplessness or of anguish.
</p>

<p>
But that flash of recognition had been too great a strain on the father&rsquo;s
bruised, enfeebled powers. He sank back again in renewed insensibility and
rigidity, which lasted for many hours, and was only broken by a flickering
return of consciousness, in which he took passively everything that was given
to him, and seemed to have a sort of infantine satisfaction in Maggie&rsquo;s
near presence,&mdash;such satisfaction as a baby has when it is returned to the
nurse&rsquo;s lap.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver sent for her sisters, and there was much wailing and lifting up
of hands below stairs. Both uncles and aunts saw that the ruin of Bessy and her
family was as complete as they had ever foreboded it, and there was a general
family sense that a judgment had fallen on Mr Tulliver, which it would be an
impiety to counteract by too much kindness. But Maggie heard little of this,
scarcely ever leaving her father&rsquo;s bedside, where she sat opposite him
with her hand on his. Mrs Tulliver wanted to have Tom fetched home, and seemed
to be thinking more of her boy even than of her husband; but the aunts and
uncles opposed this. Tom was better at school, since Mr Turnbull said there
was no immediate danger, he believed. But at the end of the second day, when
Maggie had become more accustomed to her father&rsquo;s fits of insensibility,
and to the expectation that he would revive from them, the thought of Tom had
become urgent with <i>her</i> too; and when her mother sate crying at night and
saying, &ldquo;My poor lad&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing but right he should come
home,&rdquo; Maggie said, &ldquo;Let me go for him, and tell him, mother;
I&rsquo;ll go to-morrow morning if father doesn&rsquo;t know me and want me. It
would be so hard for Tom to come home and not know anything about it
beforehand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the next morning Maggie went, as we have seen. Sitting on the coach on
their way home, the brother and sister talked to each other in sad, interrupted
whispers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They say Mr Wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land,
Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;It was the letter with that news in it that
made father ill, they think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe that scoundrel&rsquo;s been planning all along to ruin my
father,&rdquo; said Tom, leaping from the vaguest impressions to a definite
conclusion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him feel for it when I&rsquo;m a man. Mind
you never speak to Philip again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom!&rdquo; said Maggie, in a tone of sad remonstrance; but she had
no spirit to dispute anything then, still less to vex Tom by opposing him.

Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s Teraphim, or Household Gods</h3>

<p>
When the coach set down Tom and Maggie, it was five hours since she had started
from home, and she was thinking with some trembling that her father had perhaps
missed her, and asked for &ldquo;the little wench&rdquo; in vain. She thought
of no other change that might have happened.
</p>

<p>
She hurried along the gravel-walk and entered the house before Tom; but in the
entrance she was startled by a strong smell of tobacco. The parlour door was
ajar; that was where the smell came from. It was very strange; could any
visitor be smoking at a time like this? Was her mother there? If so, she must
be told that Tom was come. Maggie, after this pause of surprise, was only in
the act of opening the door when Tom came up, and they both looked into the
parlour together.
</p>

<p>
There was a coarse, dingy man, of whose face Tom had some vague recollection,
sitting in his father&rsquo;s chair, smoking, with a jug and glass beside him.
</p>

<p>
The truth flashed on Tom&rsquo;s mind in an instant. To &ldquo;have the bailiff
in the house,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to be sold up,&rdquo; were phrases which he had
been used to, even as a little boy; they were part of the disgrace and misery
of &ldquo;failing,&rdquo; of losing all one&rsquo;s money, and being
ruined,&mdash;sinking into the condition of poor working people. It seemed only
natural this should happen, since his father had lost all his property, and he
thought of no more special cause for this particular form of misfortune than
the loss of the lawsuit. But the immediate presence of this disgrace was so
much keener an experience to Tom than the worst form of apprehension, that he
felt at this moment as if his real trouble had only just begin; it was a touch
on the irritated nerve compared with its spontaneous dull aching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo; said the man, taking the pipe out of his
mouth, with rough, embarrassed civility. The two young startled faces made him
a little uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
But Tom turned away hastily without speaking; the sight was too hateful. Maggie
had not understood the appearance of this stranger, as Tom had. She followed
him, whispering: &ldquo;Who can it be, Tom? What is the matter?&rdquo; Then,
with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger might have something to do
with a change in her father, she rushed upstairs, checking herself at the
bedroom door to throw off her bonnet, and enter on tiptoe. All was silent
there; her father was lying, heedless of everything around him, with his eyes
closed as when she had left him. A servant was there, but not her mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my mother?&rdquo; she whispered. The servant did not know.
</p>

<p>
Maggie hastened out, and said to Tom; &ldquo;Father is lying quiet; let us go
and look for my mother. I wonder where she is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver was not downstairs, not in any of the bedrooms. There was but one
room below the attic which Maggie had left unsearched; it was the storeroom,
where her mother kept all her linen and all the precious &ldquo;best
things&rdquo; that were only unwrapped and brought out on special occasions.
</p>

<p>
Tom, preceding Maggie, as they returned along the passage, opened the door of
this room, and immediately said, &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver was seated there with all her laid-up treasures. One of the linen
chests was open; the silver teapot was unwrapped from its many folds of paper,
and the best china was laid out on the top of the closed linen-chest; spoons
and skewers and ladles were spread in rows on the shelves; and the poor woman
was shaking her head and weeping, with a bitter tension of the mouth, over the
mark, &ldquo;Elizabeth Dodson,&rdquo; on the corner of some tablecloths she
held in her lap.
</p>

<p>
She dropped them, and started up as Tom spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my boy, my boy!&rdquo; she said, clasping him round the neck.
&ldquo;To think as I should live to see this day! We&rsquo;re
ruined&mdash;everything&rsquo;s going to be sold up&mdash;to think as your
father should ha&rsquo; married me to bring me to this! We&rsquo;ve got
nothing&mdash;we shall be beggars&mdash;we must go to the
workhouse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She kissed him, then seated herself again, and took another tablecloth on her
lap, unfolding it a little way to look at the pattern, while the children stood
by in mute wretchedness, their minds quite filled for the moment with the words
&ldquo;beggars&rdquo; and &ldquo;workhouse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To think o&rsquo; these cloths as I spun myself,&rdquo; she went on,
lifting things out and turning them over with an excitement all the more
strange and piteous because the stout blond woman was usually so
passive,&mdash;if she had been ruffled before, it was at the surface
merely,&mdash;&ldquo;and Job Haxey wove &rsquo;em, and brought the piece home
on his back, as I remember standing at the door and seeing him come, before I
ever thought o&rsquo; marrying your father! And the pattern as I chose myself,
and bleached so beautiful, and I marked &rsquo;em so as nobody ever saw such
marking,&mdash;they must cut the cloth to get it out, for it&rsquo;s a
particular stitch. And they&rsquo;re all to be sold, and go into strange
people&rsquo;s houses, and perhaps be cut with the knives, and wore out before
I&rsquo;m dead. You&rsquo;ll never have one of &rsquo;em, my boy,&rdquo; she
said, looking up at Tom with her eyes full of tears, &ldquo;and I meant
&rsquo;em for you. I wanted you to have all o&rsquo; this pattern. Maggie could
have had the large check&mdash;it never shows so well when the dishes are on
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom was touched to the quick, but there was an angry reaction immediately. His
face flushed as he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But will my aunts let them be sold, mother? Do they know about it?
They&rsquo;ll never let your linen go, will they? Haven&rsquo;t you sent to
them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I sent Luke directly they&rsquo;d put the bailies in, and your aunt
Pullet&rsquo;s been&mdash;and, oh dear, oh dear, she cries so and says your
father&rsquo;s disgraced my family and made it the talk o&rsquo; the country;
and she&rsquo;ll buy the spotted cloths for herself, because she&rsquo;s never
had so many as she wanted o&rsquo; that pattern, and they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
go to strangers, but she&rsquo;s got more checks a&rsquo;ready nor she can do
with.&rdquo; (Here Mrs Tulliver began to lay back the tablecloths in the
chest, folding and stroking them automatically.) &ldquo;And your uncle
Glegg&rsquo;s been too, and he says things must be bought in for us to lie down
on, but he must talk to your aunt; and they&rsquo;re all coming to consult. But
I know they&rsquo;ll none of &rsquo;em take my chany,&rdquo; she added, turning
toward the cups and saucers, &ldquo;for they all found fault with &rsquo;em
when I bought &rsquo;em, &rsquo;cause o&rsquo; the small gold sprig all over
&rsquo;em, between the flowers. But there&rsquo;s none of &rsquo;em got better
chany, not even your aunt Pullet herself; and I bought it wi&rsquo; my own
money as I&rsquo;d saved ever since I was turned fifteen; and the silver
teapot, too,&mdash;your father never paid for &rsquo;em. And to think as he
should ha&rsquo; married me, and brought me to this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver burst out crying afresh, and she sobbed with her handkerchief at
her eyes a few moments, but then removing it, she said in a deprecating way,
still half sobbing, as if she were called upon to speak before she could
command her voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I <i>did</i> say to him times and times, &lsquo;Whativer you do,
don&rsquo;t go to law,&rsquo; and what more could I do? I&rsquo;ve had to sit
by while my own fortin&rsquo;s been spent, and what should ha&rsquo; been my
children&rsquo;s, too. You&rsquo;ll have niver a penny, my boy&mdash;but it
isn&rsquo;t your poor mother&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put out one arm toward Tom, looking up at him piteously with her helpless,
childish blue eyes. The poor lad went to her and kissed her, and she clung to
him. For the first time Tom thought of his father with some reproach. His
natural inclination to blame, hitherto kept entirely in abeyance toward his
father by the predisposition to think him always right, simply on the ground
that he was Tom Tulliver&rsquo;s father, was turned into this new channel by
his mother&rsquo;s plaints; and with his indignation against Wakem there began
to mingle some indignation of another sort. Perhaps his father might have
helped bringing them all down in the world, and making people talk of them with
contempt, but no one should talk long of Tom Tulliver with contempt.
</p>

<p>
The natural strength and firmness of his nature was beginning to assert itself,
urged by the double stimulus of resentment against his aunts, and the sense
that he must behave like a man and take care of his mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, mother,&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;I shall soon
be able to get money; I&rsquo;ll get a situation of some sort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless you, my boy!&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, a little soothed. Then,
looking round sadly, &ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; minded so much if
we could ha&rsquo; kept the things wi&rsquo; my name on &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger. The implied reproaches
against her father&mdash;her father, who was lying there in a sort of living
death&mdash;neutralised all her pity for griefs about tablecloths and china;
and her anger on her father&rsquo;s account was heightened by some egoistic
resentment at Tom&rsquo;s silent concurrence with her mother in shutting her
out from the common calamity. She had become almost indifferent to her
mother&rsquo;s habitual depreciation of her, but she was keenly alive to any
sanction of it, however passive, that she might suspect in Tom. Poor Maggie was
by no means made up of unalloyed devotedness, but put forth large claims for
herself where she loved strongly. She burst out at last in an agitated, almost
violent tone: &ldquo;Mother, how can you talk so; as if you cared only for
things with <i>your</i> name on, and not for what has my father&rsquo;s name
too; and to care about anything but dear father himself!&mdash;when he&rsquo;s
lying there, and may never speak to us again. Tom, you ought to say so too; you
ought not to let any one find fault with my father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie, almost choked with mingled grief and anger, left the room, and took her
old place on her father&rsquo;s bed. Her heart went out to him with a stronger
movement than ever, at the thought that people would blame him. Maggie hated
blame; she had been blamed all her life, and nothing had come of it but evil
tempers.
</p>

<p>
Her father had always defended and excused her, and her loving remembrance of
his tenderness was a force within her that would enable her to do or bear
anything for his sake.
</p>

<p>
Tom was a little shocked at Maggie&rsquo;s outburst,&mdash;telling <i>him</i>
as well as his mother what it was right to do! She ought to have learned better
than have those hectoring, assuming manners, by this time. But he presently
went into his father&rsquo;s room, and the sight there touched him in a way
that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous hour. When Maggie saw how
he was moved, she went to him and put her arm round his neck as he sat by the
bed, and the two children forgot everything else in the sense that they had one
father and one sorrow.

The Family Council</h3>

<p>
It was at eleven o&rsquo;clock the next morning that the aunts and uncles came
to hold their consultation. The fire was lighted in the large parlour, and poor
Mrs Tulliver, with a confused impression that it was a great occasion, like a
funeral, unbagged the bell-rope tassels, and unpinned the curtains, adjusting
them in proper folds, looking round and shaking her head sadly at the polished
tops and legs of the tables, which sister Pullet herself could not accuse of
insufficient brightness.
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane was not coming, he was away on business; but Mrs Deane appeared
punctually in that handsome new gig with the head to it, and the livery-servant
driving it, which had thrown so clear a light on several traits in her
character to some of her female friends in St Ogg&rsquo;s. Mr Deane had been
advancing in the world as rapidly as Mr Tulliver had been going down in it;
and in Mrs Deane&rsquo;s house the Dodson linen and plate were beginning to
hold quite a subordinate position, as a mere supplement to the handsomer
articles of the same kind, purchased in recent years,&mdash;a change which had
caused an occasional coolness in the sisterly intercourse between her and Mrs
Glegg, who felt that Susan was getting &ldquo;like the rest,&rdquo; and there
would soon be little of the true Dodson spirit surviving except in herself,
and, it might be hoped, in those nephews who supported the Dodson name on the
family land, far away in the Wolds.
</p>

<p>
People who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those immediately
under our own eyes; and it seems superfluous, when we consider the remote
geographical position of the Ethiopians, and how very little the Greeks had to
do with them, to inquire further why Homer calls them &ldquo;blameless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Deane was the first to arrive; and when she had taken her seat in the
large parlour, Mrs Tulliver came down to her with her comely face a little
distorted, nearly as it would have been if she had been crying. She was not a
woman who could shed abundant tears, except in moments when the prospect of
losing her furniture became unusually vivid, but she felt how unfitting it was
to be quite calm under present circumstances.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sister, what a world this is!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she entered;
&ldquo;what trouble, oh dear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Deane was a thin-lipped woman, who made small well-considered speeches on
peculiar occasions, repeating them afterward to her husband, and asking him if
she had not spoken very properly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sister,&rdquo; she said deliberately, &ldquo;this is a changing
world, and we don&rsquo;t know to-day what may happen tomorrow. But it&rsquo;s
right to be prepared for all things, and if trouble&rsquo;s sent, to remember
as it isn&rsquo;t sent without a cause. I&rsquo;m very sorry for you as a
sister, and if the doctor orders jelly for Mr Tulliver, I hope you&rsquo;ll
let me know. I&rsquo;ll send it willingly; for it is but right he should have
proper attendance while he&rsquo;s ill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Susan,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, rather faintly, withdrawing
her fat hand from her sister&rsquo;s thin one. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s been no
talk o&rsquo; jelly yet.&rdquo; Then after a moment&rsquo;s pause she added,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dozen o&rsquo; cut jelly-glasses upstairs&mdash;I shall
never put jelly into &rsquo;em no more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her voice was rather agitated as she uttered the last words, but the sound of
wheels diverted her thoughts. Mr and Mrs Glegg were come, and were almost
immediately followed by Mr and Mrs Pullet.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Pullet entered crying, as a compendious mode, at all times, of expressing
what were her views of life in general, and what, in brief, were the opinions
she held concerning the particular case before her.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg had on her fuzziest front, and garments which appeared to have had a
recent resurrection from rather a creasy form of burial; a costume selected
with the high moral purpose of instilling perfect humility into Bessy and her
children.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs G., won&rsquo;t you come nearer the fire?&rdquo; said her husband,
unwilling to take the more comfortable seat without offering it to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see I&rsquo;ve seated myself here, Mr Glegg,&rdquo; returned this
superior woman; &ldquo;<i>you</i> can roast yourself, if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, seating himself good-humouredly, &ldquo;and
how&rsquo;s the poor man upstairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dr Turnbull thought him a deal better this morning,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver; &ldquo;he took more notice, and spoke to me; but he&rsquo;s never
known Tom yet,&mdash;looks at the poor lad as if he was a stranger, though he
said something once about Tom and the pony. The doctor says his memory&rsquo;s
gone a long way back, and he doesn&rsquo;t know Tom because he&rsquo;s thinking
of him when he was little. Eh dear, eh dear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I doubt it&rsquo;s the water got on his brain,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet,
turning round from adjusting her cap in a melancholy way at the pier-glass.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much if he ever gets up again; and if he does, he&rsquo;ll
most like be childish, as Mr Carr was, poor man! They fed him with a spoon as
if he&rsquo;d been a babby for three year. He&rsquo;d quite lost the use of his
limbs; but then he&rsquo;d got a Bath chair, and somebody to draw him; and
that&rsquo;s what you won&rsquo;t have, I doubt, Bessy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister Pullet,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, severely, &ldquo;if I understand
right, we&rsquo;ve come together this morning to advise and consult about
what&rsquo;s to be done in this disgrace as has fallen upon the family, and not
to talk o&rsquo; people as don&rsquo;t belong to us. Mr Carr was none of our
blood, nor noways connected with us, as I&rsquo;ve ever heared.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister Glegg,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, in a pleading tone, drawing on
her gloves again, and stroking the fingers in an agitated manner, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ve got anything disrespectful to say o&rsquo; Mr Carr, I do beg of
you as you won&rsquo;t say it to me. <i>I</i> know what he was,&rdquo; she
added, with a sigh; &ldquo;his breath was short to that degree as you could
hear him two rooms off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sophy!&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, with indignant disgust, &ldquo;you
<i>do</i> talk o&rsquo; people&rsquo;s complaints till it&rsquo;s quite
undecent. But I say again, as I said before, I didn&rsquo;t come away from home
to talk about acquaintances, whether they&rsquo;d short breath or long. If we
aren&rsquo;t come together for one to hear what the other &rsquo;ull do to save
a sister and her children from the parish, <i>I</i> shall go back. <i>One</i>
can&rsquo;t act without the other, I suppose; it isn&rsquo;t to be expected as
<i>I</i> should do everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as
you&rsquo;ve been so very forrard at doing. So far as I know, this is the first
time as here you&rsquo;ve been, since it&rsquo;s been known as the
bailiff&rsquo;s in the house; and I was here yesterday, and looked at all
Bessy&rsquo;s linen and things, and I told her I&rsquo;d buy in the spotted
tablecloths. I couldn&rsquo;t speak fairer; for as for the teapot as she
doesn&rsquo;t want to go out o&rsquo; the family, it stands to sense I
can&rsquo;t do with two silver teapots, not if it <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> a
straight spout, but the spotted damask I was allays fond on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish it could be managed so as my teapot and chany and the best
castors needn&rsquo;t be put up for sale,&rdquo; said poor Mrs Tulliver,
beseechingly, &ldquo;and the sugar-tongs the first things ever I bought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that can&rsquo;t be helped, you know,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg.
&ldquo;If one o&rsquo; the family chooses to buy &rsquo;em in, they can, but
one thing must be bid for as well as another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t to be looked for,&rdquo; said uncle Pullet, with
unwonted independence of idea, &ldquo;as your own family should pay more for
things nor they&rsquo;ll fetch. They may go for an old song by auction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, &ldquo;to think o&rsquo; my
chany being sold i&rsquo; that way, and I bought it when I was married, just as
you did yours, Jane and Sophy; and I know you didn&rsquo;t like mine, because
o&rsquo; the sprig, but I was fond of it; and there&rsquo;s never been a bit
broke, for I&rsquo;ve washed it myself; and there&rsquo;s the tulips on the
cups, and the roses, as anybody might go and look at &rsquo;em for pleasure.
You wouldn&rsquo;t like <i>your</i> chany to go for an old song and be broke to
pieces, though yours has got no colour in it, Jane,&mdash;it&rsquo;s all white
and fluted, and didn&rsquo;t cost so much as mine. And there&rsquo;s the
castors, sister Deane, I can&rsquo;t think but you&rsquo;d like to have the
castors, for I&rsquo;ve heard you say they&rsquo;re pretty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve no objection to buy some of the best things,&rdquo;
said Mrs Deane, rather loftily; &ldquo;we can do with extra things in our
house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Best things!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Glegg, with severity, which had
gathered intensity from her long silence. &ldquo;It drives me past patience to
hear you all talking o&rsquo; best things, and buying in this, that, and the
other, such as silver and chany. You must bring your mind to your
circumstances, Bessy, and not be thinking o&rsquo; silver and chany; but
whether you shall get so much as a flock-bed to lie on, and a blanket to cover
you, and a stool to sit on. You must remember, if you get &rsquo;em,
it&rsquo;ll be because your friends have bought &rsquo;em for you, for
you&rsquo;re dependent upon <i>them</i> for everything; for your husband lies
there helpless, and hasn&rsquo;t got a penny i&rsquo; the world to call his
own. And it&rsquo;s for your own good I say this, for it&rsquo;s right you
should feel what your state is, and what disgrace your husband&rsquo;s brought
on your own family, as you&rsquo;ve got to look to for everything, and be
humble in your mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg paused, for speaking with much energy for the good of others is
naturally exhausting.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver, always borne down by the family predominance of sister Jane, who
had made her wear the yoke of a younger sister in very tender years, said
pleadingly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, sister, I&rsquo;ve never asked anybody to do anything,
only buy things as it &rsquo;ud be a pleasure to &rsquo;em to have, so as they
mightn&rsquo;t go and be spoiled i&rsquo; strange houses. I never asked anybody
to buy the things in for me and my children; though there&rsquo;s the linen I
spun, and I thought when Tom was born,&mdash;I thought one o&rsquo; the first
things when he was lying i&rsquo; the cradle, as all the things I&rsquo;d
bought wi&rsquo; my own money, and been so careful of, &rsquo;ud go to him. But
I&rsquo;ve said nothing as I wanted my sisters to pay their money for me. What
my husband has done for <i>his</i> sister&rsquo;s unknown, and we should
ha&rsquo; been better off this day if it hadn&rsquo;t been as he&rsquo;s lent
money and never asked for it again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, kindly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us
make things too dark. What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone. We shall make a
shift among us to buy what&rsquo;s sufficient for you; though, as Mrs G. says,
they must be useful, plain things. We mustn&rsquo;t be thinking o&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s unnecessary. A table, and a chair or two, and kitchen things, and
a good bed, and such-like. Why, I&rsquo;ve seen the day when I shouldn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; known myself if I&rsquo;d lain on sacking i&rsquo;stead o&rsquo; the
floor. We get a deal o&rsquo; useless things about us, only because we&rsquo;ve
got the money to spend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said Mrs G., &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll be kind enough to
let me speak, i&rsquo;stead o&rsquo; taking the words out o&rsquo; my
mouth,&mdash;I was going to say, Bessy, as it&rsquo;s fine talking for you to
say as you&rsquo;ve never asked us to buy anything for you; let me tell you,
you <i>ought</i> to have asked us. Pray, how are you to be purvided for, if
your own family don&rsquo;t help you? You must go to the parish, if they
didn&rsquo;t. And you ought to know that, and keep it in mind, and ask us
humble to do what we can for you, i&rsquo;stead o&rsquo; saying, and making a
boast, as you&rsquo;ve never asked us for anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You talked o&rsquo; the Mosses, and what Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s done for
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; said uncle Pullet, who became unusually suggestive where
advances of money were concerned. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t <i>they</i> been anear
you? They ought to do something as well as other folks; and if he&rsquo;s lent
&rsquo;em money, they ought to be made to pay it back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, to be sure,&rdquo; said Mrs Deane; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking
so. How is it Mr and Mrs Moss aren&rsquo;t here to meet us? It is but right
they should do their share.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, &ldquo;I never sent &rsquo;em word
about Mr Tulliver, and they live so back&rsquo;ard among the lanes at Basset,
they niver hear anything only when Mr Moss comes to market. But I niver gave
&rsquo;em a thought. I wonder Maggie didn&rsquo;t, though, for she was allays
so fond of her aunt Moss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t your children come in, Bessy?&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet,
at the mention of Maggie. &ldquo;They should hear what their aunts and uncles
have got to say; and Maggie,&mdash;when it&rsquo;s me as have paid for half her
schooling, she ought to think more of her aunt Pullet than of aunt Moss. I may
go off sudden when I get home to-day; there&rsquo;s no telling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d had <i>my</i> way,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, &ldquo;the
children &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been in the room from the first. It&rsquo;s time
they knew who they&rsquo;ve to look to, and it&rsquo;s right as <i>somebody</i>
should talk to &rsquo;em, and let &rsquo;em know their condition i&rsquo; life,
and what they&rsquo;re come down to, and make &rsquo;em feel as they&rsquo;ve
got to suffer for their father&rsquo;s faults.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go and fetch &rsquo;em, sister,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, resignedly. She was quite crushed now, and thought of the treasures
in the storeroom with no other feeling than blank despair.
</p>

<p>
She went upstairs to fetch Tom and Maggie, who were both in their
father&rsquo;s room, and was on her way down again, when the sight of the
storeroom door suggested a new thought to her. She went toward it, and left the
children to go down by themselves.
</p>

<p>
The aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the brother
and sister entered,&mdash;both with shrinking reluctance; for though Tom, with
a practical sagacity which had been roused into activity by the strong stimulus
of the new emotions he had undergone since yesterday, had been turning over in
his mind a plan which he meant to propose to one of his aunts or uncles, he
felt by no means amicably toward them, and dreaded meeting them all at once as
he would have dreaded a large dose of concentrated physic, which was but just
endurable in small draughts. As for Maggie, she was peculiarly depressed this
morning; she had been called up, after brief rest, at three o&rsquo;clock, and
had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from watching in a sick-room
through the chill hours of early twilight and breaking day,&mdash;in which the
outside day-light life seems to have no importance, and to be a mere margin to
the hours in the darkened chamber. Their entrance interrupted the conversation.
The shaking of hands was a melancholy and silent ceremony, till uncle Pullet
observed, as Tom approached him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, young sir, we&rsquo;ve been talking as we should want your pen and
ink; you can write rarely now, after all your schooling, I should think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said uncle Glegg, with admonition which he meant to be
kind, &ldquo;we must look to see the good of all this schooling, as your
father&rsquo;s sunk so much money in, now,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;When land is gone and money&rsquo;s spent,<br/>
Then learning is most excellent.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Now&rsquo;s the time, Tom, to let us see the good o&rsquo; your learning. Let
us see whether you can do better than I can, as have made my fortin without it.
But I began wi&rsquo; doing with little, you see; I could live on a basin
o&rsquo; porridge and a crust o&rsquo; bread-and-cheese. But I doubt high
living and high learning &rsquo;ull make it harder for you, young man, nor it
was for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he must do it,&rdquo; interposed aunt Glegg, energetically,
&ldquo;whether it&rsquo;s hard or no. He hasn&rsquo;t got to consider
what&rsquo;s hard; he must consider as he isn&rsquo;t to trusten to his friends
to keep him in idleness and luxury; he&rsquo;s got to bear the fruits of his
father&rsquo;s misconduct, and bring his mind to fare hard and to work hard.
And he must be humble and grateful to his aunts and uncles for what
they&rsquo;re doing for his mother and father, as must be turned out into the
streets and go to the workhouse if they didn&rsquo;t help &rsquo;em. And his
sister, too,&rdquo; continued Mrs Glegg, looking severely at Maggie, who had
sat down on the sofa by her aunt Deane, drawn to her by the sense that she was
Lucy&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;she must make up her mind to be humble and work;
for there&rsquo;ll be no servants to wait on her any more,&mdash;she must
remember that. She must do the work o&rsquo; the house, and she must respect
and love her aunts as have done so much for her, and saved their money to leave
to their nepheys and nieces.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom was still standing before the table in the centre of the group. There was a
heightened colour in his face, and he was very far from looking humbled, but he
was preparing to say, in a respectful tone, something he had previously
meditated, when the door opened and his mother re-entered.
</p>

<p>
Poor Mrs Tulliver had in her hands a small tray, on which she had placed her
silver teapot, a specimen teacup and saucer, the castors, and sugar-tongs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See here, sister,&rdquo; she said, looking at Mrs Deane, as she set the
tray on the table, &ldquo;I thought, perhaps, if you looked at the teapot
again,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good while since you saw it,&mdash;you might like the
pattern better; it makes beautiful tea, and there&rsquo;s a stand and
everything; you might use it for every day, or else lay it by for Lucy when she
goes to housekeeping. I should be so loath for &rsquo;em to buy it at the
Golden Lion,&rdquo; said the poor woman, her heart swelling, and the tears
coming,&mdash;&ldquo;my teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think of
its being scratched, and set before the travellers and folks, and my letters on
it,&mdash;see here, E. D.,&mdash;and everybody to see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, dear, dear!&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, shaking her head with deep
sadness, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very bad,&mdash;to think o&rsquo; the family
initials going about everywhere&mdash;it niver was so before; you&rsquo;re a
very unlucky sister, Bessy. But what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; buying the
teapot, when there&rsquo;s the linen and spoons and everything to go, and some
of &rsquo;em with your full name,&mdash;and when it&rsquo;s got that straight
spout, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As to disgrace o&rsquo; the family,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, &ldquo;that
can&rsquo;t be helped wi&rsquo; buying teapots. The disgrace is, for one
o&rsquo; the family to ha&rsquo; married a man as has brought her to beggary.
The disgrace is, as they&rsquo;re to be sold up. We can&rsquo;t hinder the
country from knowing that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie had started up from the sofa at the allusion to her father, but Tom saw
her action and flushed face in time to prevent her from speaking. &ldquo;Be
quiet, Maggie,&rdquo; he said authoritatively, pushing her aside. It was a
remarkable manifestation of self-command and practical judgment in a lad of
fifteen, that when his aunt Glegg ceased, he began to speak in a quiet and
respectful manner, though with a good deal of trembling in his voice; for his
mother&rsquo;s words had cut him to the quick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, aunt,&rdquo; he said, looking straight at Mrs Glegg, &ldquo;if
you think it&rsquo;s a disgrace to the family that we should be sold up,
wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to prevent it altogether? And if you and aunt
Pullet,&rdquo; he continued, looking at the latter, &ldquo;think of leaving any
money to me and Maggie, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to give it now, and pay the
debt we&rsquo;re going to be sold up for, and save my mother from parting with
her furniture?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a few moments, for every one, including Maggie, was
astonished at Tom&rsquo;s sudden manliness of tone. Uncle Glegg was the first
to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, young man, come now! You show some notion o&rsquo; things. But
there&rsquo;s the interest, you must remember; your aunts get five per cent on
their money, and they&rsquo;d lose that if they advanced it; you haven&rsquo;t
thought o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could work and pay that every year,&rdquo; said Tom, promptly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything to save my mother from parting with her
things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said uncle Glegg, admiringly. He had been drawing Tom
out, rather than reflecting on the practicability of his proposal. But he had
produced the unfortunate result of irritating his wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mr Glegg!&rdquo; said that lady, with angry sarcasm.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasant work for you to be giving my money away, as
you&rsquo;ve pretended to leave at my own disposal. And my money, as was my own
father&rsquo;s gift, and not yours, Mr Glegg; and I&rsquo;ve saved it, and
added to it myself, and had more to put out almost every year, and it&rsquo;s
to go and be sunk in other folks&rsquo; furniture, and encourage &rsquo;em in
luxury and extravagance as they&rsquo;ve no means of supporting; and I&rsquo;m
to alter my will, or have a codicil made, and leave two or three hundred less
behind me when I die,&mdash;me as have allays done right and been careful, and
the eldest o&rsquo; the family; and my money&rsquo;s to go and be squandered on
them as have had the same chance as me, only they&rsquo;ve been wicked and
wasteful. Sister Pullet, <i>you</i> may do as you like, and you may let your
husband rob you back again o&rsquo; the money he&rsquo;s given you, but that
isn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> sperrit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;La, Jane, how fiery you are!&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;ll have the blood in your head, and have to be cupped. I&rsquo;m
sorry for Bessy and her children,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I think of &rsquo;em
o&rsquo; nights dreadful, for I sleep very bad wi&rsquo; this new
medicine,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s no use for me to think o&rsquo; doing anything,
if you won&rsquo;t meet me half-way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s this to be considered,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to pay off this debt and save the furniture, when
there&rsquo;s all the law debts behind, as &rsquo;ud take every shilling, and
more than could be made out o&rsquo; land and stock, for I&rsquo;ve made that
out from Lawyer Gore. We&rsquo;d need save our money to keep the poor man with,
instead o&rsquo; spending it on furniture as he can neither eat nor drink. You
<i>will</i> be so hasty, Jane, as if I didn&rsquo;t know what was
reasonable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then speak accordingly, Mr Glegg!&rdquo; said his wife, with slow, loud
emphasis, bending her head toward him significantly.
</p>

<p>
Tom&rsquo;s countenance had fallen during this conversation, and his lip
quivered; but he was determined not to give way. He would behave like a man.
Maggie, on the contrary, after her momentary delight in Tom&rsquo;s speech, had
relapsed into her state of trembling indignation. Her mother had been standing
close by Tom&rsquo;s side, and had been clinging to his arm ever since he had
last spoken; Maggie suddenly started up and stood in front of them, her eyes
flashing like the eyes of a young lioness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you come, then,&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;talking and
interfering with us and scolding us, if you don&rsquo;t mean to do anything to
help my poor mother&mdash;your own sister,&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve no feeling for
her when she&rsquo;s in trouble, and won&rsquo;t part with anything, though you
would never miss it, to save her from pain? Keep away from us then, and
don&rsquo;t come to find fault with my father,&mdash;he was better than any of
you; he was kind,&mdash;he would have helped <i>you</i>, if you had been in
trouble. Tom and I don&rsquo;t ever want to have any of your money, if you
won&rsquo;t help my mother. We&rsquo;d rather not have it! We&rsquo;ll do
without you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie, having hurled her defiance at aunts and uncles in this way, stood
still, with her large dark eyes glaring at them, as if she were ready to await
all consequences.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver was frightened; there was something portentous in this mad
outbreak; she did not see how life could go on after it. Tom was vexed; it was
no <i>use</i> to talk so. The aunts were silent with surprise for some moments.
At length, in a case of aberration such as this, comment presented itself as
more expedient than any answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen the end o&rsquo; your trouble wi&rsquo; that
child, Bessy,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s beyond everything for
boldness and unthankfulness. It&rsquo;s dreadful. I might ha&rsquo; let alone
paying for her schooling, for she&rsquo;s worse nor ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more than what I&rsquo;ve allays said,&rdquo; followed
Mrs Glegg. &ldquo;Other folks may be surprised, but I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;ve
said over and over again,&mdash;years ago I&rsquo;ve said,&mdash;&lsquo;Mark my
words; that child &rsquo;ull come to no good; there isn&rsquo;t a bit of our
family in her.&rsquo; And as for her having so much schooling, I never thought
well o&rsquo; that. I&rsquo;d my reasons when I said <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t
pay anything toward it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s waste no more time
in talking,&mdash;let&rsquo;s go to business. Tom, now, get the pen and
ink&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While Mr Glegg was speaking, a tall dark figure was seen hurrying past the
window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Mrs Moss,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver. &ldquo;The bad
news must ha&rsquo; reached her, then&rdquo;; and she went out to open the
door, Maggie eagerly following her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fortunate,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg. &ldquo;She can agree to
the list o&rsquo; things to be bought in. It&rsquo;s but right she should do
her share when it&rsquo;s her own brother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Moss was in too much agitation to resist Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s movement,
as she drew her into the parlour automatically, without reflecting that it was
hardly kind to take her among so many persons in the first painful moment of
arrival. The tall, worn, dark-haired woman was a strong contrast to the Dodson
sisters as she entered in her shabby dress, with her shawl and bonnet looking
as if they had been hastily huddled on, and with that entire absence of
self-consciousness which belongs to keenly felt trouble. Maggie was clinging to
her arm; and Mrs Moss seemed to notice no one else except Tom, whom she went
straight up to and took by the hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear children,&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no call
to think well o&rsquo; me; I&rsquo;m a poor aunt to you, for I&rsquo;m one
o&rsquo; them as take all and give nothing. How&rsquo;s my poor brother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Turnbull thinks he&rsquo;ll get better,&rdquo; said Maggie.
&ldquo;Sit down, aunt Gritty. Don&rsquo;t fret.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my sweet child, I feel torn i&rsquo; two,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss,
allowing Maggie to lead her to the sofa, but still not seeming to notice the
presence of the rest. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve three hundred pounds o&rsquo; my
brother&rsquo;s money, and now he wants it, and you all want it, poor
things!&mdash;and yet we must be sold up to pay it, and there&rsquo;s my poor
children,&mdash;eight of &rsquo;em, and the little un of all can&rsquo;t speak
plain. And I feel as if I was a robber. But I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d no thought
as my brother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The poor woman was interrupted by a rising sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three hundred pounds! oh dear, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, who,
when she had said that her husband had done &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; things for
his sister, had not had any particular sum in her mind, and felt a wife&rsquo;s
irritation at having been kept in the dark.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What madness, to be sure!&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg. &ldquo;A man with a
family! He&rsquo;d no right to lend his money i&rsquo; that way; and without
security, I&rsquo;ll be bound, if the truth was known.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg&rsquo;s voice had arrested Mrs Moss&rsquo;s attention, and looking
up, she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, there <i>was</i> security; my husband gave a note for it.
We&rsquo;re not that sort o&rsquo; people, neither of us, as &rsquo;ud rob my
brother&rsquo;s children; and we looked to paying back the money, when the
times got a bit better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but now,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, gently, &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t your
husband no way o&rsquo; raising this money? Because it &rsquo;ud be a little
fortin, like, for these folks, if we can do without Tulliver&rsquo;s being made
a bankrupt. Your husband&rsquo;s got stock; it is but right he should raise the
money, as it seems to me,&mdash;not but what I&rsquo;m sorry for you, Mrs
Moss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sir, you don&rsquo;t know what bad luck my husband&rsquo;s had with
his stock. The farm&rsquo;s suffering so as never was for want o&rsquo; stock;
and we&rsquo;ve sold all the wheat, and we&rsquo;re behind with our
rent,&mdash;not but what we&rsquo;d like to do what&rsquo;s right, and
I&rsquo;d sit up and work half the night, if it &rsquo;ud be any good; but
there&rsquo;s them poor children,&mdash;four of &rsquo;em such little
uns&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry so, aunt; don&rsquo;t fret,&rdquo; whispered Maggie, who
had kept hold of Mrs Moss&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did Mr Tulliver let you have the money all at once?&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, still lost in the conception of things which had been &ldquo;going
on&rdquo; without her knowledge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; at twice,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, rubbing her eyes and making an
effort to restrain her tears. &ldquo;The last was after my bad illness four
years ago, as everything went wrong, and there was a new note made then. What
with illness and bad luck, I&rsquo;ve been nothing but cumber all my
life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mrs Moss,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, with decision, &ldquo;yours is a
very unlucky family; the more&rsquo;s the pity for <i>my</i> sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I set off in the cart as soon as ever I heard o&rsquo; what had
happened,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, looking at Mrs Tulliver. &ldquo;I should
never ha&rsquo; stayed away all this while, if you&rsquo;d thought well to let
me know. And it isn&rsquo;t as I&rsquo;m thinking all about ourselves, and
nothing about my brother, only the money was so on my mind, I couldn&rsquo;t
help speaking about it. And my husband and me desire to do the right thing,
sir,&rdquo; she added, looking at Mr Glegg, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll make shift
and pay the money, come what will, if that&rsquo;s all my brother&rsquo;s got
to trust to. We&rsquo;ve been used to trouble, and don&rsquo;t look for much
else. It&rsquo;s only the thought o&rsquo; my poor children pulls me i&rsquo;
two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s this to be thought on, Mrs Moss,&rdquo; said Mr
Glegg, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s right to warn you,&mdash;if Tulliver&rsquo;s made
a bankrupt, and he&rsquo;s got a note-of-hand of your husband&rsquo;s for three
hundred pounds, you&rsquo;ll be obliged to pay it; th&rsquo; assignees
&rsquo;ull come on you for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear!&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, thinking of the bankruptcy,
and not of Mrs Moss&rsquo;s concern in it. Poor Mrs Moss herself listened in
trembling submission, while Maggie looked with bewildered distress at Tom to
see if <i>he</i> showed any signs of understanding this trouble, and caring
about poor aunt Moss. Tom was only looking thoughtful, with his eyes on the
tablecloth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if he isn&rsquo;t made bankrupt,&rdquo; continued Mr Glegg,
&ldquo;as I said before, three hundred pounds &rsquo;ud be a little fortin for
him, poor man. We don&rsquo;t know but what he may be partly helpless, if he
ever gets up again. I&rsquo;m very sorry if it goes hard with you, Mrs Moss,
but my opinion is, looking at it one way, it&rsquo;ll be right for you to raise
the money; and looking at it th&rsquo; other way, you&rsquo;ll be obliged to
pay it. You won&rsquo;t think ill o&rsquo; me for speaking the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said Tom, looking up suddenly from his meditative view of
the tablecloth, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be right for my aunt Moss
to pay the money if it would be against my father&rsquo;s will for her to pay
it; would it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg looked surprised for a moment or two before he said: &ldquo;Why, no,
perhaps not, Tom; but then he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; destroyed the note, you know.
We must look for the note. What makes you think it &rsquo;ud be against his
will?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Tom, colouring, but trying to speak firmly, in spite of
a boyish tremor, &ldquo;I remember quite well, before I went to school to Mr
Stelling, my father said to me one night, when we were sitting by the fire
together, and no one else was in the room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom hesitated a little, and then went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said something to me about Maggie, and then he said:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve always been good to my sister, though she married against my
will, and I&rsquo;ve lent Moss money; but I shall never think of distressing
him to pay it; I&rsquo;d rather lose it. My children must not mind being the
poorer for that.&rsquo; And now my father&rsquo;s ill, and not able to speak
for himself, I shouldn&rsquo;t like anything to be done contrary to what he
said to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but then, my boy,&rdquo; said Uncle Glegg, whose good feeling led
him to enter into Tom&rsquo;s wish, but who could not at once shake off his
habitual abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying securities, or
alienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference in a
man&rsquo;s property, &ldquo;we should have to make away wi&rsquo; the note,
you know, if we&rsquo;re to guard against what may happen, supposing your
father&rsquo;s made bankrupt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg,&rdquo; interrupted his wife, severely, &ldquo;mind what
you&rsquo;re saying. You&rsquo;re putting yourself very forrard in other
folks&rsquo;s business. If you speak rash, don&rsquo;t say it was my
fault.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s such a thing as I never heared of before,&rdquo; said uncle
Pullet, who had been making haste with his lozenge in order to express his
amazement,&mdash;&ldquo;making away with a note! I should think anybody could
set the constable on you for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, &ldquo;if the note&rsquo;s worth
all that money, why can&rsquo;t we pay it away, and save my things from going
away? We&rsquo;ve no call to meddle with your uncle and aunt Moss, Tom, if you
think your father &rsquo;ud be angry when he gets well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver had not studied the question of exchange, and was straining her
mind after original ideas on the subject.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, pooh! you women don&rsquo;t understand these things,&rdquo;
said uncle Glegg. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way o&rsquo; making it safe for Mr
and Mrs Moss but destroying the note.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I hope you&rsquo;ll help me do it, uncle,&rdquo; said Tom,
earnestly. &ldquo;If my father shouldn&rsquo;t get well, I should be very
unhappy to think anything had been done against his will that I could hinder.
And I&rsquo;m sure he meant me to remember what he said that evening. I ought
to obey my father&rsquo;s wish about his property.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Even Mrs Glegg could not withhold her approval from Tom&rsquo;s words; she
felt that the Dodson blood was certainly speaking in him, though, if his father
had been a Dodson, there would never have been this wicked alienation of money.
Maggie would hardly have restrained herself from leaping on Tom&rsquo;s neck,
if her aunt Moss had not prevented her by herself rising and taking Tom&rsquo;s
hand, while she said, with rather a choked voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be the poorer for this, my dear boy, if there&rsquo;s
a God above; and if the money&rsquo;s wanted for your father, Moss and me
&rsquo;ull pay it, the same as if there was ever such security. We&rsquo;ll do
as we&rsquo;d be done by; for if my children have got no other luck,
they&rsquo;ve got an honest father and mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, who had been meditating after Tom&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing any wrong by the creditors, supposing
your father <i>was</i> bankrupt. I&rsquo;ve been thinking o&rsquo; that, for
I&rsquo;ve been a creditor myself, and seen no end o&rsquo; cheating. If he
meant to give your aunt the money before ever he got into this sad work
o&rsquo; lawing, it&rsquo;s the same as if he&rsquo;d made away with the note
himself; for he&rsquo;d made up his mind to be that much poorer. But
there&rsquo;s a deal o&rsquo; things to be considered, young man,&rdquo; Mr
Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, &ldquo;when you come to money
business, and you may be taking one man&rsquo;s dinner away to make another
man&rsquo;s breakfast. You don&rsquo;t understand that, I doubt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Tom, decidedly. &ldquo;I know if I owe money to
one man, I&rsquo;ve no right to give it to another. But if my father had made
up his mind to give my aunt the money before he was in debt, he had a right to
do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well done, young man! I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d been so
sharp,&rdquo; said uncle Glegg, with much candor. &ldquo;But perhaps your
father <i>did</i> make away with the note. Let us go and see if we can find it
in the chest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my father&rsquo;s room. Let us go too, aunt Gritty,&rdquo;
whispered Maggie.

<h3><a name="chap24"></a>Chapter IV.<br/>
A Vanishing Gleam</h3>

<p>
Mr Tulliver, even between the fits of spasmodic rigidity which had recurred at
intervals ever since he had been found fallen from his horse, was usually in so
apathetic a condition that the exits and entrances into his room were not felt
to be of great importance. He had lain so still, with his eyes closed, all this
morning, that Maggie told her aunt Moss she must not expect her father to take
any notice of them.
</p>

<p>
They entered very quietly, and Mrs Moss took her seat near the head of the
bed, while Maggie sat in her old place on the bed, and put her hand on her
father&rsquo;s without causing any change in his face.
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg and Tom had also entered, treading softly, and were busy selecting
the key of the old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had brought from his
father&rsquo;s bureau. They succeeded in opening the chest,&mdash;which stood
opposite the foot of Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s bed,&mdash;and propping the lid with
the iron holder, without much noise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tin box,&rdquo; whispered Mr Glegg; &ldquo;he&rsquo;d
most like put a small thing like a note in there. Lift it out, Tom; but
I&rsquo;ll just lift up these deeds,&mdash;they&rsquo;re the deeds o&rsquo; the
house and mill, I suppose,&mdash;and see what there is under &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg had lifted out the parchments, and had fortunately drawn back a
little, when the iron holder gave way, and the heavy lid fell with a loud bang
that resounded over the house.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of the strong
vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the frame of the prostrate
man, and for the time completely shook off the obstruction of paralysis. The
chest had belonged to his father and his father&rsquo;s father, and it had
always been rather a solemn business to visit it. All long-known objects, even
a mere window fastening or a particular door-latch, have sounds which are a
sort of recognised voice to us,&mdash;a voice that will thrill and awaken, when
it has been used to touch deep-lying fibres. In the same moment, when all the
eyes in the room were turned upon him, he started up and looked at the chest,
the parchments in Mr Glegg&rsquo;s hand, and Tom holding the tin box, with a
glance of perfect consciousness and recognition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to do with those deeds?&rdquo; he said, in his
ordinary tone of sharp questioning whenever he was irritated. &ldquo;Come here,
Tom. What do you do, going to my chest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom obeyed, with some trembling; it was the first time his father had
recognised him. But instead of saying anything more to him, his father
continued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at Mr Glegg and the
deeds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s been happening, then?&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;What
are you meddling with my deeds for? Is Wakem laying hold of everything? Why
don&rsquo;t you tell me what you&rsquo;ve been a-doing?&rdquo; he added
impatiently, as Mr Glegg advanced to the foot of the bed before speaking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, friend Tulliver,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, in a soothing tone.
&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s getting hold of anything as yet. We only came to look and
see what was in the chest. You&rsquo;ve been ill, you know, and we&rsquo;ve had
to look after things a bit. But let&rsquo;s hope you&rsquo;ll soon be well
enough to attend to everything yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver looked around him meditatively, at Tom, at Mr Glegg, and at
Maggie; then suddenly appearing aware that some one was seated by his side at
the head of the bed he turned sharply round and saw his sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Gritty!&rdquo; he said, in the half-sad, affectionate tone in which
he had been wont to speak to her. &ldquo;What! you&rsquo;re there, are you? How
could you manage to leave the children?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, brother!&rdquo; said good Mrs Moss, too impulsive to be prudent,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful I&rsquo;m come now to see you yourself again; I
thought you&rsquo;d never know us any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! have I had a stroke?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, anxiously, looking
at Mr Glegg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fall from your horse&mdash;shook you a bit,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all, I
think,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll soon get over it,
let&rsquo;s hope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver fixed his eyes on the bed-clothes, and remained silent for two or
three minutes. A new shadow came over his face. He looked up at Maggie first,
and said in a lower tone, &ldquo;You got the letter, then, my wench?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; she said, kissing him with a full heart. She felt as
if her father were come back to her from the dead, and her yearning to show him
how she had always loved him could be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo; he said, so preoccupied that he
received the kiss as passively as some quiet animal might have received it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s downstairs with my aunts, father. Shall I fetch her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay; poor Bessy!&rdquo; and his eyes turned toward Tom as Maggie left
the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take care of &rsquo;em both if I die, you know,
Tom. You&rsquo;ll be badly off, I doubt. But you must see and pay everybody.
And mind,&mdash;there&rsquo;s fifty pound o&rsquo; Luke&rsquo;s as I put into
the business,&mdash;he gave me a bit at a time, and he&rsquo;s got nothing to
show for it. You must pay him first thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Uncle Glegg involuntarily shook his head, and looked more concerned than ever,
but Tom said firmly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, father. And haven&rsquo;t you a note from my uncle Moss for three
hundred pounds? We came to look for that. What do you wish to be done about it,
father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m glad you thought o&rsquo; that, my lad,&rdquo; said Mr
Tulliver. &ldquo;I allays meant to be easy about that money, because o&rsquo;
your aunt. You mustn&rsquo;t mind losing the money, if they can&rsquo;t pay
it,&mdash;and it&rsquo;s like enough they can&rsquo;t. The note&rsquo;s in that
box, mind! I allays meant to be good to you, Gritty,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver,
turning to his sister; &ldquo;but you know you aggravated me when you would
have Moss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment Maggie re-entered with her mother, who came in much agitated by
the news that her husband was quite himself again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bessy,&rdquo; he said, as she kissed him, &ldquo;you must forgive
me if you&rsquo;re worse off than you ever expected to be.
</p>

<p>
But it&rsquo;s the fault o&rsquo; the law,&mdash;it&rsquo;s none o&rsquo;
mine,&rdquo; he added angrily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fault o&rsquo; raskills.
Tom, you mind this: if ever you&rsquo;ve got the chance, you make Wakem smart.
If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re a good-for-nothing son. You might horse-whip
him, but he&rsquo;d set the law on you,&mdash;the law&rsquo;s made to take care
o&rsquo; raskills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver was getting excited, and an alarming flush was on his face. Mr
Glegg wanted to say something soothing, but he was prevented by Mr
Tulliver&rsquo;s speaking again to his wife. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make a shift
to pay everything, Bessy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and yet leave you your
furniture; and your sisters&rsquo;ll do something for you&mdash;and
Tom&rsquo;ll grow up&mdash;though what he&rsquo;s to be I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done what I could&mdash;I&rsquo;ve given him a
eddication&mdash;and there&rsquo;s the little wench, she&rsquo;ll get
married&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a poor tale&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted, and with the last
words the poor man fell again, rigid and insensible. Though this was only a
recurrence of what had happened before, it struck all present as if it had been
death, not only from its contrast with the completeness of the revival, but
because his words had all had reference to the possibility that his death was
near. But with poor Tulliver death was not to be a leap; it was to be a long
descent under thickening shadows.
</p>

<p>
Mr Turnbull was sent for; but when he heard what had passed, he said this
complete restoration, though only temporary, was a hopeful sign, proving that
there was no permanent lesion to prevent ultimate recovery.
</p>

<p>
Among the threads of the past which the stricken man had gathered up, he had
omitted the bill of sale; the flash of memory had only lit up prominent ideas,
and he sank into forgetfulness again with half his humiliation unlearned.
</p>

<p>
But Tom was clear upon two points,&mdash;that his uncle Moss&rsquo;s note must
be destroyed; and that Luke&rsquo;s money must be paid, if in no other way, out
of his own and Maggie&rsquo;s money now in the savings bank. There were
subjects, you perceive, on which Tom was much quicker than on the niceties of
classical construction, or the relations of a mathematical demonstration.

<h3><a name="chap25"></a>Chapter V.<br/>
Tom Applies His Knife to the Oyster</h3>

<p>
The next day, at ten o&rsquo;clock, Tom was on his way to St Ogg&rsquo;s, to
see his uncle Deane, who was to come home last night, his aunt had said; and
Tom had made up his mind that his uncle Deane was the right person to ask for
advice about getting some employment. He was in a great way of business; he had
not the narrow notions of uncle Glegg; and he had risen in the world on a scale
of advancement which accorded with Tom&rsquo;s ambition.
</p>

<p>
It was a dark, chill, misty morning, likely to end in rain,&mdash;one of those
mornings when even happy people take refuge in their hopes. And Tom was very
unhappy; he felt the humiliation as well as the prospective hardships of his
lot with all the keenness of a proud nature; and with all his resolute
dutifulness toward his father there mingled an irrepressible indignation
against him which gave misfortune the less endurable aspect of a wrong. Since
these were the consequences of going to law, his father was really blamable, as
his aunts and uncles had always said he was; and it was a significant
indication of Tom&rsquo;s character, that though he thought his aunts ought to
do something more for his mother, he felt nothing like Maggie&rsquo;s violent
resentment against them for showing no eager tenderness and generosity. There
were no impulses in Tom that led him to expect what did not present itself to
him as a right to be demanded. Why should people give away their money
plentifully to those who had not taken care of their own money? Tom saw some
justice in severity; and all the more, because he had confidence in himself
that he should never deserve that just severity. It was very hard upon him that
he should be put at this disadvantage in life by his father&rsquo;s want of
prudence; but he was not going to complain and to find fault with people
because they did not make everything easy for him. He would ask no one to help
him, more than to give him work and pay him for it. Poor Tom was not without
his hopes to take refuge in under the chill damp imprisonment of the December
fog, which seemed only like a part of his home troubles. At sixteen, the mind
that has the strongest affinity for fact cannot escape illusion and
self-flattery; and Tom, in sketching his future, had no other guide in
arranging his facts than the suggestions of his own brave self-reliance. Both
Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, he knew, had been very poor once; he did not want to
save money slowly and retire on a moderate fortune like his uncle Glegg, but he
would be like his uncle Deane&mdash;get a situation in some great house of
business and rise fast. He had scarcely seen anything of his uncle Deane for
the last three years&mdash;the two families had been getting wider apart; but
for this very reason Tom was the more hopeful about applying to him. His uncle
Glegg, he felt sure, would never encourage any spirited project, but he had a
vague imposing idea of the resources at his uncle Deane&rsquo;s command. He had
heard his father say, long ago, how Deane had made himself so valuable to Guest
&amp; Co. that they were glad enough to offer him a share in the business; that
was what Tom resolved <i>he</i> would do. It was intolerable to think of being
poor and looked down upon all one&rsquo;s life. He would provide for his mother
and sister, and make every one say that he was a man of high character. He
leaped over the years in this way, and, in the haste of strong purpose and
strong desire, did not see how they would be made up of slow days, hours, and
minutes.
</p>

<p>
By the time he had crossed the stone bridge over the Floss and was entering St
Ogg&rsquo;s, he was thinking that he would buy his father&rsquo;s mill and land
again when he was rich enough, and improve the house and live there; he should
prefer it to any smarter, newer place, and he could keep as many horses and
dogs as he liked.
</p>

<p>
Walking along the street with a firm, rapid step, at this point in his reverie
he was startled by some one who had crossed without his notice, and who said to
him in a rough, familiar voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Master Tom, how&rsquo;s your father this morning?&rdquo; It was a
publican of St Ogg&rsquo;s, one of his father&rsquo;s customers.
</p>

<p>
Tom disliked being spoken to just then; but he said civilly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
still very ill, thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s been a sore chance for you, young man, hasn&rsquo;t
it,&mdash;this lawsuit turning out against him?&rdquo; said the publican, with
a confused, beery idea of being good-natured.
</p>

<p>
Tom reddened and passed on; he would have felt it like the handling of a
bruise, even if there had been the most polite and delicate reference to his
position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tulliver&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said the publican to a grocer
standing on the adjacent door-step.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the grocer, &ldquo;I thought I knew his features. He
takes after his mother&rsquo;s family; she was a Dodson. He&rsquo;s a fine,
straight youth; what&rsquo;s he been brought up to?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! to turn up his nose at his father&rsquo;s customers, and be a fine
gentleman,&mdash;not much else, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom, roused from his dream of the future to a thorough consciousness of the
present, made all the greater haste to reach the warehouse offices of Guest
&amp; Co., where he expected to find his uncle Deane. But this was Mr
Deane&rsquo;s morning at the bank, a clerk told him, and with some contempt for
his ignorance; Mr Deane was not to be found in River Street on a Thursday
morning.
</p>

<p>
At the bank Tom was admitted into the private room where his uncle was,
immediately after sending in his name. Mr Deane was auditing accounts; but he
looked up as Tom entered, and putting out his hand, said, &ldquo;Well, Tom,
nothing fresh the matter at home, I hope? How&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much the same, thank you, uncle,&rdquo; said Tom, feeling nervous.
&ldquo;But I want to speak to you, please, when you&rsquo;re at liberty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down, sit down,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, relapsing into his accounts,
in which he and the managing-clerk remained so absorbed for the next half-hour
that Tom began to wonder whether he should have to sit in this way till the
bank closed,&mdash;there seemed so little tendency toward a conclusion in the
quiet, monotonous procedure of these sleek, prosperous men of business. Would
his uncle give him a place in the bank? It would be very dull, prosy work, he
thought, writing there forever to the loud ticking of a timepiece. He preferred
some other way of getting rich. But at last there was a change; his uncle took
a pen and wrote something with a flourish at the end.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just step up to Torry&rsquo;s now, Mr Spence, will
you?&rdquo; said Mr Deane, and the clock suddenly became less loud and
deliberate in Tom&rsquo;s ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Tom,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, when they were alone, turning his
substantial person a little in his chair, and taking out his snuff-box;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the business, my boy; what&rsquo;s the business?&rdquo; Mr
Deane, who had heard from his wife what had passed the day before, thought Tom
was come to appeal to him for some means of averting the sale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me for troubling you, uncle,&rdquo; said Tom,
colouring, but speaking in a tone which, though, tremulous, had a certain proud
independence in it; &ldquo;but I thought you were the best person to advise me
what to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr Deane, reserving his pinch of snuff, and looking at
Tom with new attention, &ldquo;let us hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to get a situation, uncle, so that I may earn some money,&rdquo;
said Tom, who never fell into circumlocution.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A situation?&rdquo; said Mr Deane, and then took his pinch of snuff
with elaborate justice to each nostril. Tom thought snuff-taking a most
provoking habit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, let me see, how old are you?&rdquo; said Mr Deane, as he threw
himself backward again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sixteen; I mean, I am going in seventeen,&rdquo; said Tom, hoping his
uncle noticed how much beard he had.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see; your father had some notion of making you an engineer, I
think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think I could get any money at that for a long while,
could I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; but people don&rsquo;t get much money at anything, my
boy, when they&rsquo;re only sixteen. You&rsquo;ve had a good deal of
schooling, however; I suppose you&rsquo;re pretty well up in accounts, eh? You
understand book keeping?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, rather falteringly. &ldquo;I was in Practice. But
Mr Stelling says I write a good hand, uncle. That&rsquo;s my writing,&rdquo;
added Tom, laying on the table a copy of the list he had made yesterday.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good. But, you see, the best hand in
the world&rsquo;ll not get you a better place than a copying-clerk&rsquo;s, if
you know nothing of book-keeping,&mdash;nothing of accounts. And a
copying-clerk&rsquo;s a cheap article. But what have you been learning at
school, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane had not occupied himself with methods of education, and had no
precise conception of what went forward in expensive schools.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We learned Latin,&rdquo; said Tom, pausing a little between each item,
as if he were turning over the books in his school-desk to assist his
memory,&mdash;&ldquo;a good deal of Latin; and the last year I did Themes, one
week in Latin and one in English; and Greek and Roman history; and Euclid; and
I began Algebra, but I left it off again; and we had one day every week for
Arithmetic. Then I used to have drawing-lessons; and there were several other
books we either read or learned out of,&mdash;English Poetry, and Horæ Paulinæ
and Blair&rsquo;s Rhetoric, the last half.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane tapped his snuff-box again and screwed up his mouth; he felt in the
position of many estimable persons when they had read the New Tariff, and found
how many commodities were imported of which they knew nothing; like a cautious
man of business, he was not going to speak rashly of a raw material in which he
had had no experience. But the presumption was, that if it had been good for
anything, so successful a man as himself would hardly have been ignorant of it.
</p>

<p>
About Latin he had an opinion, and thought that in case of another war, since
people would no longer wear hair-powder, it would be well to put a tax upon
Latin, as a luxury much run upon by the higher classes, and not telling at all
on the ship-owning department. But, for what he knew, the Horæ Paulinæ might be
something less neutral. On the whole, this list of acquirements gave him a sort
of repulsion toward poor Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, in rather a cold, sardonic tone,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had three years at these things,&mdash;you must be pretty
strong in &rsquo;em. Hadn&rsquo;t you better take up some line where
they&rsquo;ll come in handy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom coloured, and burst out, with new energy:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not have any employment of that sort, uncle. I
don&rsquo;t like Latin and those things. I don&rsquo;t know what I could do
with them unless I went as usher in a school; and I don&rsquo;t know them well
enough for that! besides, I would as soon carry a pair of panniers. I
don&rsquo;t want to be that sort of person. I should like to enter into some
business where I can get on,&mdash;a manly business, where I should have to
look after things, and get credit for what I did. And I shall want to keep my
mother and sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, young gentleman,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, with that tendency to
repress youthful hopes which stout and successful men of fifty find one of
their easiest duties, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s sooner said than done,&mdash;sooner
said than done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> get on in that way, uncle?&rdquo; said Tom,
a little irritated that Mr Deane did not enter more rapidly into his views.
&ldquo;I mean, didn&rsquo;t you rise from one place to another through your
abilities and good conduct?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, spreading himself in his chair a
little, and entering with great readiness into a retrospect of his own career.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you how I got on. It wasn&rsquo;t by getting astride
a stick and thinking it would turn into a horse if I sat on it long enough. I
kept my eyes and ears open, sir, and I wasn&rsquo;t too fond of my own back,
and I made my master&rsquo;s interest my own. Why, with only looking into what
went on in the mill, I found out how there was a waste of five hundred a-year
that might be hindered. Why, sir, I hadn&rsquo;t more schooling to begin with
than a charity boy; but I saw pretty soon that I couldn&rsquo;t get on far
enough without mastering accounts, and I learned &rsquo;em between working
hours, after I&rsquo;d been unlading. Look here.&rdquo; Mr Deane opened a book
and pointed to the page. &ldquo;I write a good hand enough, and I&rsquo;ll
match anybody at all sorts of reckoning by the head; and I got it all by hard
work, and paid for it out of my own earnings,&mdash;often out of my own dinner
and supper. And I looked into the nature of all the things we had to do in the
business, and picked up knowledge as I went about my work, and turned it over
in my head. Why, I&rsquo;m no mechanic,&mdash;I never pretended to be&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ve thought of a thing or two that the mechanics never thought of, and
it&rsquo;s made a fine difference in our returns. And there isn&rsquo;t an
article shipped or unshipped at our wharf but I know the quality of it. If I
got places, sir, it was because I made myself fit for &rsquo;em. If you want to
slip into a round hole, you must make a ball of yourself; that&rsquo;s where it
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane tapped his box again. He had been led on by pure enthusiasm in his
subject, and had really forgotten what bearing this retrospective survey had on
his listener. He had found occasion for saying the same thing more than once
before, and was not distinctly aware that he had not his port-wine before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, uncle,&rdquo; said Tom, with a slight complaint in his tone,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I should like to do. Can&rsquo;t <i>I</i> get on in
the same way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the same way?&rdquo; said Mr Deane, eyeing Tom with quiet
deliberation. &ldquo;There go two or three questions to that, Master Tom. That
depends on what sort of material you are, to begin with, and whether
you&rsquo;ve been put into the right mill. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.
Your poor father went the wrong way to work in giving you an education. It
wasn&rsquo;t my business, and I didn&rsquo;t interfere; but it is as I thought
it would be. You&rsquo;ve had a sort of learning that&rsquo;s all very well for
a young fellow like our Mr Stephen Guest, who&rsquo;ll have nothing to do but
sign checks all his life, and may as well have Latin inside his head as any
other sort of stuffing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, uncle,&rdquo; said Tom, earnestly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why the
Latin need hinder me from getting on in business. I shall soon forget it all;
it makes no difference to me. I had to do my lessons at school, but I always
thought they&rsquo;d never be of any use to me afterward; I didn&rsquo;t care
about them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, that&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Mr Deane; &ldquo;but it
doesn&rsquo;t alter what I was going to say. Your Latin and rigmarole may soon
dry off you, but you&rsquo;ll be but a bare stick after that. Besides,
it&rsquo;s whitened your hands and taken the rough work out of you. And what do
you know? Why, you know nothing about book-keeping, to begin with, and not so
much of reckoning as a common shopman. You&rsquo;ll have to begin at a low
round of the ladder, let me tell you, if you mean to get on in life. It&rsquo;s
no use forgetting the education your father&rsquo;s been paying for, if you
don&rsquo;t give yourself a new un.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom bit his lips hard; he felt as if the tears were rising, and he would rather
die than let them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want me to help you to a situation,&rdquo; Mr Deane went on;
&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ve no fault to find with that. I&rsquo;m willing to do
something for you. But you youngsters nowadays think you&rsquo;re to begin with
living well and working easy; you&rsquo;ve no notion of running afoot before
you get horseback. Now, you must remember what you are,&mdash;you&rsquo;re a
lad of sixteen, trained to nothing particular. There&rsquo;s heaps of your
sort, like so many pebbles, made to fit in nowhere. Well, you might be
apprenticed to some business,&mdash;a chemist&rsquo;s and druggist&rsquo;s
perhaps; your Latin might come in a bit there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom was going to speak, but Mr Deane put up his hand and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop! hear what I&rsquo;ve got to say. You don&rsquo;t want to be a
&rsquo;prentice,&mdash;I know, I know,&mdash;you want to make more haste, and
you don&rsquo;t want to stand behind a counter. But if you&rsquo;re a
copying-clerk, you&rsquo;ll have to stand behind a desk, and stare at your ink
and paper all day; there isn&rsquo;t much out-look there, and you won&rsquo;t
be much wiser at the end of the year than at the beginning. The world
isn&rsquo;t made of pen, ink, and paper, and if you&rsquo;re to get on in the
world, young man, you must know what the world&rsquo;s made of. Now the best
chance for you &rsquo;ud be to have a place on a wharf, or in a warehouse,
where you&rsquo;d learn the smell of things, but you wouldn&rsquo;t like that,
I&rsquo;ll be bound; you&rsquo;d have to stand cold and wet, and be shouldered
about by rough fellows. You&rsquo;re too fine a gentleman for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane paused and looked hard at Tom, who certainly felt some inward
struggle before he could reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would rather do what will be best for me in the end, sir; I would put
up with what was disagreeable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well, if you can carry it out. But you must remember it
isn&rsquo;t only laying hold of a rope, you must go on pulling. It&rsquo;s the
mistake you lads make that have got nothing either in your brains or your
pocket, to think you&rsquo;ve got a better start in the world if you stick
yourselves in a place where you can keep your coats clean, and have the
shopwenches take you for fine gentlemen. That wasn&rsquo;t the way <i>I</i>
started, young man; when I was sixteen, my jacket smelt of tar, and I
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of handling cheeses. That&rsquo;s the reason I can wear
good broadcloth now, and have my legs under the same table with the heads of
the best firms in St Ogg&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Uncle Deane tapped his box, and seemed to expand a little under his waistcoat
and gold chain, as he squared his shoulders in the chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should
do for? I should like to set to work at once,&rdquo; said Tom, with a slight
tremor in his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop a bit, stop a bit; we mustn&rsquo;t be in too great a hurry. You
must bear in mind, if I put you in a place you&rsquo;re a bit young for,
because you happen to be my nephew, I shall be responsible for you. And
there&rsquo;s no better reason, you know, than your being my nephew; because it
remains to be seen whether you&rsquo;re good for anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope I shall never do you any discredit, uncle,&rdquo; said Tom, hurt,
as all boys are at the statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel no
ground for trusting them. &ldquo;I care about my own credit too much for
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well done, Tom, well done! That&rsquo;s the right spirit, and I never
refuse to help anybody if they&rsquo;ve a mind to do themselves justice.
There&rsquo;s a young man of two-and-twenty I&rsquo;ve got my eye on now. I
shall do what I can for that young man; he&rsquo;s got some pith in him. But
then, you see, he&rsquo;s made good use of his time,&mdash;a first-rate
calculator,&mdash;can tell you the cubic contents of anything in no time, and
put me up the other day to a new market for Swedish bark; he&rsquo;s uncommonly
knowing in manufactures, that young fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better set about learning book-keeping, hadn&rsquo;t I,
uncle?&rdquo; said Tom, anxious to prove his readiness to exert himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, you can&rsquo;t do amiss there. But&mdash;Ah, Spence,
you&rsquo;re back again. Well Tom, there&rsquo;s nothing more to be said just
now, I think, and I must go to business again. Good-by. Remember me to your
mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane put out his hand, with an air of friendly dismissal, and Tom had not
courage to ask another question, especially in the presence of Mr Spence. So
he went out again into the cold damp air. He had to call at his uncle
Glegg&rsquo;s about the money in the Savings Bank, and by the time he set out
again the mist had thickened, and he could not see very far before him; but
going along River Street again, he was startled, when he was within two yards
of the projecting side of a shop-window, by the words &ldquo;Dorlcote
Mill&rdquo; in large letters on a hand-bill, placed as if on purpose to stare
at him. It was the catalogue of the sale to take place the next week; it was a
reason for hurrying faster out of the town.
</p>

<p>
Poor Tom formed no visions of the distant future as he made his way homeward;
he only felt that the present was very hard. It seemed a wrong toward him that
his uncle Deane had no confidence in him,&mdash;did not see at once that he
should acquit himself well, which Tom himself was as certain of as of the
daylight. Apparently he, Tom Tulliver, was likely to be held of small account
in the world; and for the first time he felt a sinking of heart under the sense
that he really was very ignorant, and could do very little. Who was that
enviable young man that could tell the cubic contents of things in no time, and
make suggestions about Swedish bark! Tom had been used to be so entirely
satisfied with himself, in spite of his breaking down in a demonstration, and
construing <i>nunc illas promite vires</i> as &ldquo;now promise those
men&rdquo;; but now he suddenly felt at a disadvantage, because he knew less
than some one else knew. There must be a world of things connected with that
Swedish bark, which, if he only knew them, might have helped him to get on. It
would have been much easier to make a figure with a spirited horse and a new
saddle.
</p>

<p>
Two hours ago, as Tom was walking to St Ogg&rsquo;s, he saw the distant future
before him as he might have seen a tempting stretch of smooth sandy beach
beyond a belt of flinty shingles; he was on the grassy bank then, and thought
the shingles might soon be passed. But now his feet were on the sharp stones;
the belt of shingles had widened, and the stretch of sand had dwindled into
narrowness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did my Uncle Deane say, Tom?&rdquo; said Maggie, putting her arm
through Tom&rsquo;s as he was warming himself rather drearily by the kitchen
fire. &ldquo;Did he say he would give you a situation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t say that. He didn&rsquo;t quite promise me anything;
he seemed to think I couldn&rsquo;t have a very good situation. I&rsquo;m too
young.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t he speak kindly, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kindly? Pooh! what&rsquo;s the use of talking about that? I
wouldn&rsquo;t care about his speaking kindly, if I could get a situation. But
it&rsquo;s such a nuisance and bother; I&rsquo;ve been at school all this while
learning Latin and things,&mdash;not a bit of good to me,&mdash;and now my
uncle says I must set about learning book-keeping and calculation, and those
things. He seems to make out I&rsquo;m good for nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom&rsquo;s mouth twitched with a bitter expression as he looked at the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what a pity we haven&rsquo;t got Dominie Sampson!&rdquo; said
Maggie, who couldn&rsquo;t help mingling some gayety with their sadness.
&ldquo;If he had taught me book-keeping by double entry and after the Italian
method, as he did Lucy Bertram, I could teach you, Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> teach! Yes, I dare say. That&rsquo;s always the tone you
take,&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Tom, I was only joking,&rdquo; said Maggie, putting her cheek
against his coat-sleeve.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s always the same, Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom, with the little
frown he put on when he was about to be justifiably severe. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
always setting yourself up above me and every one else, and I&rsquo;ve wanted
to tell you about it several times. You ought not to have spoken as you did to
my uncles and aunts; you should leave it to me to take care of my mother and
you, and not put yourself forward. You think you know better than any one, but
you&rsquo;re almost always wrong. I can judge much better than you can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor Tom! he had just come from being lectured and made to feel his
inferiority; the reaction of his strong, self-asserting nature must take place
somehow; and here was a case in which he could justly show himself dominant.
Maggie&rsquo;s cheek flushed and her lip quivered with conflicting resentment
and affection, and a certain awe as well as admiration of Tom&rsquo;s firmer
and more effective character. She did not answer immediately; very angry words
rose to her lips, but they were driven back again, and she said at last:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You often think I&rsquo;m conceited, Tom, when I don&rsquo;t mean what I
say at all in that way. I don&rsquo;t mean to put myself above you; I know you
behaved better than I did yesterday. But you are always so harsh to me,
Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With the last words the resentment was rising again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not harsh,&rdquo; said Tom, with severe decision.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always kind to you, and so I shall be; I shall always take
care of you. But you must mind what I say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Their mother came in now, and Maggie rushed away, that her burst of tears,
which she felt must come, might not happen till she was safe upstairs. They
were very bitter tears; everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to
Maggie; there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she
fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there were people who
were always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one
happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside
the books was not a happy one, Maggie felt; it seemed to be a world where
people behaved the best to those they did not pretend to love, and that did not
belong to them. And if life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie?
Nothing but poverty and the companionship of her mother&rsquo;s narrow griefs,
perhaps of her father&rsquo;s heart-cutting childish dependence. There is no
hopelessness so sad as that of early youth, when the soul is made up of wants,
and has no long memories, no superadded life in the life of others; though we
who looked on think lightly of such premature despair, as if our vision of the
future lightened the blind sufferer&rsquo;s present.
</p>

<p>
Maggie, in her brown frock, with her eyes reddened and her heavy hair pushed
back, looking from the bed where her father lay to the dull walls of this sad
chamber which was the centre of her world, was a creature full of eager,
passionate longings for all that was beautiful and glad; thirsty for all
knowledge; with an ear straining after dreamy music that died away and would
not come near to her; with a blind, unconscious yearning for something that
would link together the wonderful impressions of this mysterious life, and give
her soul a sense of home in it.
</p>

<p>
No wonder, when there is this contrast between the outward and the inward, that
painful collisions come of it.

<h3><a name="chap26"></a>Chapter VI.<br/>
Tending to Refute the Popular Prejudice against the Present of a Pocket-Knife</h3>

<p>
In that dark time of December, the sale of the household furniture lasted
beyond the middle of the second day. Mr Tulliver, who had begun, in his
intervals of consciousness, to manifest an irritability which often appeared to
have as a direct effect the recurrence of spasmodic rigidity and insensibility,
had lain in this living death throughout the critical hours when the noise of
the sale came nearest to his chamber. Mr Turnbull had decided that it would be
a less risk to let him remain where he was than to remove him to Luke&rsquo;s
cottage,&mdash;a plan which the good Luke had proposed to Mrs Tulliver,
thinking it would be very bad if the master were &ldquo;to waken up&rdquo; at
the noise of the sale; and the wife and children had sat imprisoned in the
silent chamber, watching the large prostrate figure on the bed, and trembling
lest the blank face should suddenly show some response to the sounds which fell
on their own ears with such obstinate, painful repetition.
</p>

<p>
But it was over at last, that time of importunate certainty and eye-straining
suspense. The sharp sound of a voice, almost as metallic as the rap that
followed it, had ceased; the tramping of footsteps on the gravel had died out.
Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s blond face seemed aged ten years by the last thirty
hours; the poor woman&rsquo;s mind had been busy divining when her favourite
things were being knocked down by the terrible hammer; her heart had been
fluttering at the thought that first one thing and then another had gone to be
identified as hers in the hateful publicity of the Golden Lion; and all the
while she had to sit and make no sign of this inward agitation. Such things
bring lines in well-rounded faces, and broaden the streaks of white among the
hairs that once looked as if they had been dipped in pure sunshine. Already, at
three o&rsquo;clock, Kezia, the good-hearted, bad-tempered housemaid, who
regarded all people that came to the sale as her personal enemies, the dirt on
whose feet was of a peculiarly vile quality, had begun to scrub and swill with
an energy much assisted by a continual low muttering against &ldquo;folks as
came to buy up other folk&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; and made light of
&ldquo;scrazing&rdquo; the tops of mahogany tables over which better folks than
themselves had had to&mdash;suffer a waste of tissue through evaporation. She
was not scrubbing indiscriminately, for there would be further dirt of the same
atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away their purchases; but
she was bent on bringing the parlour, where that &ldquo;pipe-smoking pig,&rdquo;
the bailiff, had sat, to such an appearance of scant comfort as could be given
to it by cleanliness and the few articles of furniture bought in for the
family. Her mistress and the young folks should have their tea in it that
night, Kezia was determined.
</p>

<p>
It was between five and six o&rsquo;clock, near the usual teatime, when she
came upstairs and said that Master Tom was wanted. The person who wanted him
was in the kitchen, and in the first moments, by the imperfect fire and candle
light, Tom had not even an indefinite sense of any acquaintance with the rather
broad-set but active figure, perhaps two years older than himself, that looked
at him with a pair of blue eyes set in a disc of freckles, and pulled some
curly red locks with a strong intention of respect. A low-crowned
oilskin-covered hat, and a certain shiny deposit of dirt on the rest of the
costume, as of tablets prepared for writing upon, suggested a calling that had
to do with boats; but this did not help Tom&rsquo;s memory.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sarvant, Master Tom,&rdquo; said he of the red locks, with a smile which
seemed to break through a self-imposed air of melancholy. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know me again, I doubt,&rdquo; he went on, as Tom continued to look
at him inquiringly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to talk to you by yourself a bit,
please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fire i&rsquo; the parlour, Master Tom,&rdquo; said Kezia,
who objected to leaving the kitchen in the crisis of toasting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come this way, then,&rdquo; said Tom, wondering if this young fellow
belonged to Guest &amp; Co.&rsquo;s Wharf, for his imagination ran continually
toward that particular spot; and uncle Deane might any time be sending for him
to say that there was a situation at liberty.
</p>

<p>
The bright fire in the parlour was the only light that showed the few chairs,
the bureau, the carpetless floor, and the one table&mdash;no, not the
<i>one</i> table; there was a second table, in a corner, with a large Bible and
a few other books upon it. It was this new strange bareness that Tom felt
first, before he thought of looking again at the face which was also lit up by
the fire, and which stole a half-shy, questioning glance at him as the entirely
strange voice said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why! you don&rsquo;t remember Bob, then, as you gen the pocket-knife to,
Mr Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The rough-handled pocket-knife was taken out in the same moment, and the
largest blade opened by way of irresistible demonstration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! Bob Jakin?&rdquo; said Tom, not with any cordial delight, for he
felt a little ashamed of that early intimacy symbolised by the pocket-knife,
and was not at all sure that Bob&rsquo;s motives for recalling it were entirely
admirable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Bob Jakin, if Jakin it must be, &rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s so
many Bobs as you went arter the squerrils with, that day as I plumped right
down from the bough, and bruised my shins a good un&mdash;but I got the
squerril tight for all that, an&rsquo; a scratter it was. An&rsquo; this
littlish blade&rsquo;s broke, you see, but I wouldn&rsquo;t hev a new un put
in, &rsquo;cause they might be cheatin&rsquo; me an&rsquo; givin&rsquo; me
another knife instid, for there isn&rsquo;t such a blade i&rsquo; the
country,&mdash;it&rsquo;s got used to my hand, like. An&rsquo; there was niver
nobody else gen me nothin&rsquo; but what I got by my own sharpness, only you,
Mr Tom; if it wasn&rsquo;t Bill Fawks as gen me the terrier pup istid o&rsquo;
drowndin&rsquo;t it, an&rsquo; I had to jaw him a good un afore he&rsquo;d give
it me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob spoke with a sharp and rather treble volubility, and got through his long
speech with surprising despatch, giving the blade of his knife an affectionate
rub on his sleeve when he had finished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bob,&rdquo; said Tom, with a slight air of patronage, the
foregoing reminscences having disposed him to be as friendly as was becoming,
though there was no part of his acquaintance with Bob that he remembered better
than the cause of their parting quarrel; &ldquo;is there anything I can do for
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, no, Mr Tom,&rdquo; answered Bob, shutting up his knife with a
click and returning it to his pocket, where he seemed to be feeling for
something else. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; come back upon you now
ye&rsquo;re i&rsquo; trouble, an&rsquo; folks say as the master, as I used to
frighten the birds for, an&rsquo; he flogged me a bit for fun when he catched
me eatin&rsquo; the turnip, as they say he&rsquo;ll niver lift up his head no
more,&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; come now to ax you to gi&rsquo; me
another knife &rsquo;cause you gen me one afore. If a chap gives me one black
eye, that&rsquo;s enough for me; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ax him for another afore
I sarve him out; an&rsquo; a good turn&rsquo;s worth as much as a bad un,
anyhow. I shall niver grow down&rsquo;ards again, Mr Tom, an&rsquo; you war
the little chap as I liked the best when <i>I</i> war a little chap, for all
you leathered me, and wouldn&rsquo;t look at me again. There&rsquo;s Dick
Brumby, there, I could leather him as much as I&rsquo;d a mind; but lors! you
get tired o&rsquo; leatherin&rsquo; a chap when you can niver make him see what
you want him to shy at. I&rsquo;n seen chaps as &rsquo;ud stand starin&rsquo;
at a bough till their eyes shot out, afore they&rsquo;d see as a bird&rsquo;s
tail warn&rsquo;t a leaf. It&rsquo;s poor work goin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; such raff.
But you war allays a rare un at shying, Mr Tom, an&rsquo; I could trusten to
you for droppin&rsquo; down wi&rsquo; your stick in the nick o&rsquo; time at a
runnin&rsquo; rat, or a stoat, or that, when I war a-beatin&rsquo; the
bushes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob had drawn out a dirty canvas bag, and would perhaps not have paused just
then if Maggie had not entered the room and darted a look of surprise and
curiosity at him, whereupon he pulled his red locks again with due respect. But
the next moment the sense of the altered room came upon Maggie with a force
that overpowered the thought of Bob&rsquo;s presence. Her eyes had immediately
glanced from him to the place where the bookcase had hung; there was nothing
now but the oblong unfaded space on the wall, and below it the small table with
the Bible and the few other books.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom!&rdquo; she burst out, clasping her hands, &ldquo;where are the
books? I thought my uncle Glegg said he would buy them. Didn&rsquo;t he? Are
those all they&rsquo;ve left us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Tom, with a sort of desperate indifference.
&ldquo;Why should they buy many books when they bought so little
furniture?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, her eyes filling with tears, as she
rushed up to the table to see what books had been rescued. &ldquo;Our dear old
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress that you coloured with your little paints; and that
picture of Pilgrim with a mantle on, looking just like a turtle&mdash;oh
dear!&rdquo; Maggie went on, half sobbing as she turned over the few books,
&ldquo;I thought we should never part with that while we lived; everything is
going away from us; the end of our lives will have nothing in it like the
beginning!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie turned away from the table and threw herself into a chair, with the big
tears ready to roll down her cheeks, quite blinded to the presence of Bob, who
was looking at her with the pursuant gaze of an intelligent dumb animal, with
perceptions more perfect than his comprehension.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bob,&rdquo; said Tom, feeling that the subject of the books was
unseasonable, &ldquo;I suppose you just came to see me because we&rsquo;re in
trouble? That was very good-natured of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how it is, Master Tom,&rdquo; said Bob, beginning to
untwist his canvas bag. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;n been with a barge this two
&rsquo;ear; that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;n been gettin&rsquo; my
livin&rsquo;,&mdash;if it wasn&rsquo;t when I was tentin&rsquo; the furnace,
between whiles, at Torry&rsquo;s mill. But a fortni&rsquo;t ago I&rsquo;d a
rare bit o&rsquo; luck,&mdash;I allays thought I was a lucky chap, for I niver
set a trap but what I catched something; but this wasn&rsquo;t trap, it was a
fire i&rsquo; Torry&rsquo;s mill, an&rsquo; I doused it, else it &rsquo;ud set
th&rsquo; oil alight, an&rsquo; the genelman gen me ten suvreigns; he gen me
&rsquo;em himself last week. An&rsquo; he said first, I was a sperrited
chap,&mdash;but I knowed that afore,&mdash;but then he outs wi&rsquo; the ten
suvreigns, an&rsquo; that war summat new. Here they are, all but one!&rdquo;
Here Bob emptied the canvas bag on the table. &ldquo;An&rsquo; when I&rsquo;d
got &rsquo;em, my head was all of a boil like a kettle o&rsquo; broth,
thinkin&rsquo; what sort o&rsquo; life I should take to, for there war a many
trades I&rsquo;d thought on; for as for the barge, I&rsquo;m clean tired out
wi&rsquo;t, for it pulls the days out till they&rsquo;re as long as pigs&rsquo;
chitterlings. An&rsquo; I thought first I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; ferrets an&rsquo;
dogs, an&rsquo; be a rat-catcher; an&rsquo; then I thought as I should like a
bigger way o&rsquo; life, as I didn&rsquo;t know so well; for I&rsquo;n seen to
the bottom o&rsquo; rat-catching; an&rsquo; I thought, an&rsquo; thought, till
at last I settled I&rsquo;d be a packman,&mdash;for they&rsquo;re knowin&rsquo;
fellers, the packmen are,&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d carry the lightest things I
could i&rsquo; my pack; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;d be a use for a feller&rsquo;s
tongue, as is no use neither wi&rsquo; rats nor barges. An&rsquo; I should go
about the country far an&rsquo; wide, an&rsquo; come round the women wi&rsquo;
my tongue, an&rsquo; get my dinner hot at the public,&mdash;lors! it &rsquo;ud
be a lovely life!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob paused, and then said, with defiant decision, as if resolutely turning his
back on that paradisaic picture:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind about it, not a chip! An&rsquo; I&rsquo;n changed
one o&rsquo; the suvreigns to buy my mother a goose for dinner, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;n bought a blue plush wescoat, an&rsquo; a sealskin cap,&mdash;for if I
meant to be a packman, I&rsquo;d do it respectable. But I don&rsquo;t mind
about it, not a chip! My yead isn&rsquo;t a turnip, an&rsquo; I shall
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps have a chance o&rsquo; dousing another fire afore long.
I&rsquo;m a lucky chap. So I&rsquo;ll thank you to take the nine suvreigns, Mr
Tom, and set yoursen up with &rsquo;em somehow, if it&rsquo;s true as the
master&rsquo;s broke. They mayn&rsquo;t go fur enough, but they&rsquo;ll
help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom was touched keenly enough to forget his pride and suspicion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very kind fellow, Bob,&rdquo; he said, colouring, with
that little diffident tremor in his voice which gave a certain charm even to
Tom&rsquo;s pride and severity, &ldquo;and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget you
again, though I didn&rsquo;t know you this evening. But I can&rsquo;t take the
nine sovereigns; I should be taking your little fortune from you, and they
wouldn&rsquo;t do me much good either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they, Mr Tom?&rdquo; said Bob, regretfully. &ldquo;Now
don&rsquo;t say so &rsquo;cause you think I want &rsquo;em. I aren&rsquo;t a
poor chap. My mother gets a good penn&rsquo;orth wi&rsquo; picking feathers
an&rsquo; things; an&rsquo; if she eats nothin&rsquo; but
bread-an&rsquo;-water, it runs to fat. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m such a lucky chap;
an&rsquo; I doubt you aren&rsquo;t quite so lucky, Mr Tom,&mdash;th&rsquo; old
master isn&rsquo;t, anyhow,&mdash;an&rsquo; so you might take a slice o&rsquo;
my luck, an&rsquo; no harm done. Lors! I found a leg o&rsquo; pork i&rsquo; the
river one day; it had tumbled out o&rsquo; one o&rsquo; them round-sterned
Dutchmen, I&rsquo;ll be bound. Come, think better on it, Mr Tom, for old
&rsquo;quinetance&rsquo; sake, else I shall think you bear me a grudge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob pushed the sovereigns forward, but before Tom could speak Maggie, clasping
her hands, and looking penitently at Bob, said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry, Bob; I never thought you were so good. Why, I
think you&rsquo;re the kindest person in the world!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob had not been aware of the injurious opinion for which Maggie was performing
an inward act of penitence, but he smiled with pleasure at this handsome
eulogy,&mdash;especially from a young lass who, as he informed his mother that
evening, had &ldquo;such uncommon eyes, they looked somehow as they made him
feel nohow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed Bob, I can&rsquo;t take them,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t think I feel your kindness less because I say no. I don&rsquo;t
want to take anything from anybody, but to work my own way. And those
sovereigns wouldn&rsquo;t help me much&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t
really&mdash;if I were to take them. Let me shake hands with you
instead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom put out his pink palm, and Bob was not slow to place his hard, grimy hand
within it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me put the sovereigns in the bag again,&rdquo; said Maggie;
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll come and see us when you&rsquo;ve bought your pack,
Bob.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like as if I&rsquo;d come out o&rsquo; make believe, o&rsquo;
purpose to show &rsquo;em you,&rdquo; said Bob, with an air of discontent, as
Maggie gave him the bag again, &ldquo;a-taking &rsquo;em back i&rsquo; this
way. I <i>am</i> a bit of a Do, you know; but it isn&rsquo;t that sort o&rsquo;
Do,&mdash;it&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y when a feller&rsquo;s a big rogue, or a big
flat, I like to let him in a bit, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you be up to any tricks, Bob,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;else you&rsquo;ll get transported some day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; not me, Mr Tom,&rdquo; said Bob, with an air of cheerful
confidence. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law again&rsquo; flea-bites. If I
wasn&rsquo;t to take a fool in now and then, he&rsquo;d niver get any wiser.
But, lors! hev a suvreign to buy you and Miss summat, on&rsquo;y for a
token&mdash;just to match my pocket-knife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While Bob was speaking he laid down the sovereign, and resolutely twisted up
his bag again. Tom pushed back the gold, and said, &ldquo;No, indeed, Bob;
thank you heartily, but I can&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo; And Maggie, taking it
between her fingers, held it up to Bob and said, more persuasively:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not now, but perhaps another time. If ever Tom or my father wants help
that you can give, we&rsquo;ll let you know; won&rsquo;t we, Tom? That&rsquo;s
what you would like,&mdash;to have us always depend on you as a friend that we
can go to,&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it, Bob?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Miss, and thank you,&rdquo; said Bob, reluctantly taking the money;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like, anything as you like. An&rsquo; I wish
you good-by, Miss, and good-luck, Mr Tom, and thank you for shaking hands
wi&rsquo; me, <i>though</i> you wouldn&rsquo;t take the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kezia&rsquo;s entrance, with very black looks, to inquire if she
shouldn&rsquo;t bring in the tea now, or whether the toast was to get hardened
to a brick, was a seasonable check on Bob&rsquo;s flux of words, and hastened
his parting bow.

How a Hen Takes to Stratagem</h3>

<p>
The days passed, and Mr Tulliver showed, at least to the eyes of the medical
man, stronger and stronger symptoms of a gradual return to his normal
condition; the paralytic obstruction was, little by little, losing its
tenacity, and the mind was rising from under it with fitful struggles, like a
living creature making its way from under a great snowdrift, that slides and
slides again, and shuts up the newly made opening.
</p>

<p>
Time would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed, if it had only been
measured by the doubtful, distant hope which kept count of the moments within
the chamber; but it was measured for them by a fast-approaching dread which
made the nights come too quickly. While Mr Tulliver was slowly becoming
himself again, his lot was hastening toward its moment of most palpable change.
The taxing-masters had done their work like any respectable gunsmith
conscientiously preparing the musket, that, duly pointed by a brave arm, will
spoil a life or two. Allocaturs, filing of bills in Chancery, decrees of sale,
are legal chain-shot or bomb-shells that can never hit a solitary mark, but
must fall with widespread shattering. So deeply inherent is it in this life of
ours that men have to suffer for each other&rsquo;s sins, so inevitably
diffusive is human suffering, that even justice makes its victims, and we can
conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in pulsations of
unmerited pain.
</p>

<p>
By the beginning of the second week in January, the bills were out advertising
the sale, under a decree of Chancery, of Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s farming and other
stock, to be followed by a sale of the mill and land, held in the proper
after-dinner hour at the Golden Lion. The miller himself, unaware of the lapse
of time, fancied himself still in that first stage of his misfortunes when
expedients might be thought of; and often in his conscious hours talked in a
feeble, disjointed manner of plans he would carry out when he &ldquo;got
well.&rdquo; The wife and children were not without hope of an issue that would
at least save Mr Tulliver from leaving the old spot, and seeking an entirely
strange life. For uncle Deane had been induced to interest himself in this
stage of the business. It would not, he acknowledged, be a bad speculation for
Guest &amp; Co. to buy Dorlcote Mill, and carry on the business, which was a
good one, and might be increased by the addition of steam power; in which case
Tulliver might be retained as manager. Still, Mr Deane would say nothing
decided about the matter; the fact that Wakem held the mortgage on the land
might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate, and further, to outbid
the cautious firm of Guest &amp; Co., who did not carry on business on
sentimental grounds. Mr Deane was obliged to tell Mrs Tulliver something to
that effect, when he rode over to the mill to inspect the books in company with
Mrs Glegg; for she had observed that &ldquo;if Guest &amp;Co. would only think
about it, Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s father and grandfather had been carrying on
Dorlcote Mill long before the oil-mill of that firm had been so much as thought
of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane, in reply, doubted whether that was precisely the relation between
the two mills which would determine their value as investments. As for uncle
Glegg, the thing lay quite beyond his imagination; the good-natured man felt
sincere pity for the Tulliver family, but his money was all locked up in
excellent mortgages, and he could run no risk; that would be unfair to his own
relatives; but he had made up his mind that Tulliver should have some new
flannel waistcoats which he had himself renounced in favour of a more elastic
commodity, and that he would buy Mrs Tulliver a pound of tea now and then; it
would be a journey which his benevolence delighted in beforehand, to carry the
tea and see her pleasure on being assured it was the best black.
</p>

<p>
Still, it was clear that Mr Deane was kindly disposed toward the Tullivers.
One day he had brought Lucy, who was come home for the Christmas holidays, and
the little blond angel-head had pressed itself against Maggie&rsquo;s darker
cheek with many kisses and some tears. These fair slim daughters keep up a
tender spot in the heart of many a respectable partner in a respectable firm,
and perhaps Lucy&rsquo;s anxious, pitying questions about her poor cousins
helped to make uncle Deane more prompt in finding Tom a temporary place in the
warehouse, and in putting him in the way of getting evening lessons in
book-keeping and calculation.
</p>

<p>
That might have cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little, if there had not
come at the same time the much-dreaded blow of finding that his father must be
a bankrupt, after all; at least, the creditors must be asked to take less than
their due, which to Tom&rsquo;s untechnical mind was the same thing as
bankruptcy. His father must not only be said to have &ldquo;lost his
property,&rdquo; but to have &ldquo;failed,&rdquo;&mdash;the word that carried
the worst obloquy to Tom&rsquo;s mind. For when the defendant&rsquo;s claim for
costs had been satisfied, there would remain the friendly bill of Mr Gore, and
the deficiency at the bank, as well as the other debts which would make the
assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion; &ldquo;not more than ten or
twelve shillings in the pound,&rdquo; predicted Mr Deane, in a decided tone,
tightening his lips; and the words fell on Tom like a scalding liquied, leaving
a continual smart.
</p>

<p>
He was sadly in want of something to keep up his spirits a little in the
unpleasant newness of his position,&mdash;suddenly transported from the easy
carpeted <i>ennui</i> of study-hours at Mr Stelling&rsquo;s, and the busy
idleness of castle-building in a &ldquo;last half&rdquo; at school, to the
companionship of sacks and hides, and bawling men thundering down heavy weights
at his elbow. The first step toward getting on in the world was a chill, dusty,
noisy affair, and implied going without one&rsquo;s tea in order to stay in St
Ogg&rsquo;s and have an evening lesson from a one-armed elderly clerk, in a
room smelling strongly of bad tobacco. Tom&rsquo;s young pink-and-white face
had its colours very much deadened by the time he took off his hat at home, and
sat down with keen hunger to his supper. No wonder he was a little cross if his
mother or Maggie spoke to him.
</p>

<p>
But all this while Mrs Tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which she, and
no one else, would avert the result most to be dreaded, and prevent Wakem from
entertaining the purpose of bidding for the mill. Imagine a truly respectable
and amiable hen, by some portentous anomaly, taking to reflection and inventing
combinations by which she might prevail on Hodge not to wring her neck, or send
her and her chicks to market; the result could hardly be other than much
cackling and fluttering. Mrs Tulliver, seeing that everything had gone wrong,
had begun to think she had been too passive in life; and that, if she had
applied her mind to business, and taken a strong resolution now and then, it
would have been all the better for her and her family. Nobody, it appeared, had
thought of going to speak to Wakem on this business of the mill; and yet, Mrs
Tulliver reflected, it would have been quite the shortest method of securing
the right end. It would have been of no use, to be sure, for Mr Tulliver to
go,&mdash;even if he had been able and willing,&mdash;for he had been
&ldquo;going to law against Wakem&rdquo; and abusing him for the last ten
years; Wakem was always likely to have a spite against him. And now that Mrs
Tulliver had come to the conclusion that her husband was very much in the wrong
to bring her into this trouble, she was inclined to think that his opinion of
Wakem was wrong too. To be sure, Wakem had &ldquo;put the bailies in the house,
and sold them up&rdquo;; but she supposed he did that to please the man that
lent Mr Tulliver the money, for a lawyer had more folks to please than one,
and he wasn&rsquo;t likely to put Mr Tulliver, who had gone to law with him,
above everybody else in the world. The attorney might be a very reasonable man;
why not? He had married a Miss Clint, and at the time Mrs Tulliver had heard
of that marriage, the summer when she wore her blue satin spencer, and had not
yet any thoughts of Mr Tulliver, she knew no harm of Wakem. And certainly
toward herself, whom he knew to have been a Miss Dodson, it was out of all
possibility that he could entertain anything but good-will, when it was once
brought home to his observation that she, for her part, had never wanted to go
to law, and indeed was at present disposed to take Mr Wakem&rsquo;s view of
all subjects rather than her husband&rsquo;s. In fact, if that attorney saw a
respectable matron like herself disposed &ldquo;to give him good words,&rdquo;
why shouldn&rsquo;t he listen to her representations? For she would put the
matter clearly before him, which had never been done yet. And he would never go
and bid for the mill on purpose to spite her, an innocent woman, who thought it
likely enough that she had danced with him in their youth at Squire
Darleigh&rsquo;s, for at those big dances she had often and often danced with
young men whose names she had forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver hid these reasonings in her own bosom; for when she had thrown
out a hint to Mr Deane and Mr Glegg that she wouldn&rsquo;t mind going to
speak to Wakem herself, they had said, &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let Wakem alone,&rdquo; in the tone of men
who were not likely to give a candid attention to a more definite exposition of
her project; still less dared she mention the plan to Tom and Maggie, for
&ldquo;the children were always so against everything their mother said&rdquo;;
and Tom, she observed, was almost as much set against Wakem as his father was.
But this unusual concentration of thought naturally gave Mrs Tulliver an
unusual power of device and determination: and a day or two before the sale, to
be held at the Golden Lion, when there was no longer any time to be lost, she
carried out her plan by a stratagem. There were pickles in question, a large
stock of pickles and ketchup which Mrs Tulliver possessed, and which Mr
Hyndmarsh, the grocer, would certainly purchase if she could transact the
business in a personal interview, so she would walk with Tom to St Ogg&rsquo;s
that morning; and when Tom urged that she might let the pickles be at
present,&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t like her to go about just yet,&mdash;she
appeared so hurt at this conduct in her son, contradicting her about pickles
which she had made after the family receipts inherited from his own
grandmother, who had died when his mother was a little girl, that he gave way,
and they walked together until she turned toward Danish Street, where Mr
Hyndmarsh retailed his grocery, not far from the offices of Mr Wakem.
</p>

<p>
That gentleman was not yet come to his office; would Mrs Tulliver sit down by
the fire in his private room and wait for him? She had not long to wait before
the punctual attorney entered, knitting his brow with an examining glance at
the stout blond woman who rose, curtsying deferentially,&mdash;a tallish man,
with an aquiline nose and abundant iron-gray hair. You have never seen Mr
Wakem before, and are possibly wondering whether he was really as eminent a
rascal, and as crafty, bitter an enemy of honest humanity in general, and of
Mr Tulliver in particular, as he is represented to be in that eidolon or
portrait of him which we have seen to exist in the miller&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that the irascible miller was a man to interpret any chance-shot
that grazed him as an attempt on his own life, and was liable to entanglements
in this puzzling world, which, due consideration had to his own infallibility,
required the hypothesis of a very active diabolical agency to explain them. It
is still possible to believe that the attorney was not more guilty toward him
than an ingenious machine, which performs its work with much regularity, is
guilty toward the rash man who, venturing too near it, is caught up by some
fly-wheel or other, and suddenly converted into unexpected mince-meat.
</p>

<p>
But it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his person;
the lines and lights of the human countenance are like other symbols,&mdash;not
always easy to read without a key. On an <i>a priori</i> view of Wakem&rsquo;s
aquiline nose, which offended Mr Tulliver, there was not more rascality than
in the shape of his stiff shirt-collar, though this too along with his nose,
might have become fraught with damnatory meaning when once the rascality was
ascertained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs Tulliver, I think?&rdquo; said Mr Wakem.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray be seated. You have some business with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, beginning to feel alarmed at
her own courage, now she was really in presence of the formidable man, and
reflecting that she had not settled with herself how she should begin. Mr
Wakem felt in his waistcoat pockets, and looked at her in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; she began at last,&mdash;&ldquo;I hope, sir,
you&rsquo;re not a-thinking as <i>I</i> bear you any ill-will because o&rsquo;
my husband&rsquo;s losing his lawsuit, and the bailies being put in, and the
linen being sold,&mdash;oh dear!&mdash;for I wasn&rsquo;t brought up in that
way. I&rsquo;m sure you remember my father, sir, for he was close friends with
Squire Darleigh, and we allays went to the dances there, the Miss
Dodsons,&mdash;nobody could be more looked on,&mdash;and justly, for there was
four of us, and you&rsquo;re quite aware as Mrs Glegg and Mrs Deane are my
sisters. And as for going to law and losing money, and having sales before
you&rsquo;re dead, I never saw anything o&rsquo; that before I was married, nor
for a long while after. And I&rsquo;m not to be answerable for my bad luck
i&rsquo; marrying out o&rsquo; my own family into one where the goings-on was
different. And as for being drawn in t&rsquo; abuse you as other folks abuse
you, sir, <i>that</i> I niver was, and nobody can say it of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver shook her head a little, and looked at the hem of her
pocket handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of what you say, Mrs Tulliver,&rdquo; said Mr
Wakem, with cold politeness. &ldquo;But you have some question to ask
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, yes. But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve said to
myself,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve said you&rsquo;d had some nat&rsquo;ral feeling; and
as for my husband, as hasn&rsquo;t been himself for this two months, I&rsquo;m
not a-defending him, in no way, for being so hot about th&rsquo;
erigation,&mdash;not but what there&rsquo;s worse men, for he never wronged
nobody of a shilling nor a penny, not willingly; and as for his fieriness and
lawing, what could I do? And him struck as if it was with death when he got the
letter as said you&rsquo;d the hold upo&rsquo; the land. But I can&rsquo;t
believe but what you&rsquo;ll behave as a gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does all this mean, Mrs Tulliver?&rdquo; said Mr Wakem rather
sharply. &ldquo;What do you want to ask me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, sir, if you&rsquo;ll be so good,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver,
starting a little, and speaking more hurriedly,&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll be
so good not to buy the mill an&rsquo; the land,&mdash;the land wouldn&rsquo;t
so much matter, only my husband ull&rsquo; be like mad at your having
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Something like a new thought flashed across Mr Wakem&rsquo;s face as he said,
&ldquo;Who told you I meant to buy it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, sir, it&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; my inventing, and I should never
ha&rsquo; thought of it; for my husband, as ought to know about the law, he
allays used to say as lawyers had never no call to buy anything,&mdash;either
lands or houses,&mdash;for they allays got &rsquo;em into their hands other
ways. An&rsquo; I should think that &rsquo;ud be the way with you, sir; and I
niver said as you&rsquo;d be the man to do contrairy to that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, who was it that <i>did</i> say so?&rdquo; said Wakem, opening
his desk, and moving things about, with the accompaniment of an almost
inaudible whistle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, sir, it was Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, as have all the management;
and Mr Deane thinks as Guest &amp;Co. &rsquo;ud buy the mill and let Mr
Tulliver work it for &rsquo;em, if you didn&rsquo;t bid for it and raise the
price. And it &rsquo;ud be such a thing for my husband to stay where he is, if
he could get his living: for it was his father&rsquo;s before him, the mill
was, and his grandfather built it, though I wasn&rsquo;t fond o&rsquo; the
noise of it, when first I was married, for there was no mills in our
family,&mdash;not the Dodson&rsquo;s,&mdash;and if I&rsquo;d known as the mills
had so much to do with the law, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been me as &rsquo;ud
have been the first Dodson to marry one; but I went into it blindfold, that I
did, erigation and everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! Guest &amp;Co. would keep the mill in their own hands, I suppose,
and pay your husband wages?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, sir, it&rsquo;s hard to think of,&rdquo; said poor Mrs
Tulliver, a little tear making its way, &ldquo;as my husband should take wage.
But it &rsquo;ud look more like what used to be, to stay at the mill than to go
anywhere else; and if you&rsquo;ll only think&mdash;if you was to bid for the
mill and buy it, my husband might be struck worse than he was before, and niver
get better again as he&rsquo;s getting now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my
manager in the same way, how then?&rdquo; said Mr Wakem.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sir, I doubt he could niver be got to do it, not if the very mill
stood still to beg and pray of him. For your name&rsquo;s like poison to him,
it&rsquo;s so as never was; and he looks upon it as you&rsquo;ve been the ruin
of him all along, ever since you set the law on him about the road through the
meadow,&mdash;that&rsquo;s eight year ago, and he&rsquo;s been going on ever
since&mdash;as I&rsquo;ve allays told him he was wrong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pig-headed, foul-mouthed fool!&rdquo; burst out Mr Wakem,
forgetting himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, sir!&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, frightened at a result so
different from the one she had fixed her mind on; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wish
to contradict you, but it&rsquo;s like enough he&rsquo;s changed his mind with
this illness,&mdash;he&rsquo;s forgot a many things he used to talk about. And
you wouldn&rsquo;t like to have a corpse on your mind, if he was to die; and
they <i>do</i> say as it&rsquo;s allays unlucky when Dorlcote Mill changes
hands, and the water might all run away, and <i>then</i>&mdash;not as I&rsquo;m
wishing you any ill-luck, sir, for I forgot to tell you as I remember your
wedding as if it was yesterday; Mrs Wakem was a Miss Clint, I know
<i>that;</i> and my boy, as there isn&rsquo;t a nicer, handsomer, straighter
boy nowhere, went to school with your son&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Wakem rose, opened the door, and called to one of his clerks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must excuse me for interrupting you, Mrs Tulliver; I have business
that must be attended to; and I think there is nothing more necessary to be
said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you <i>would</i> bear it in mind, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver,
rising, &ldquo;and not run against me and my children; and I&rsquo;m not
denying Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s been in the wrong, but he&rsquo;s been punished
enough, and there&rsquo;s worse men, for it&rsquo;s been giving to other folks
has been his fault. He&rsquo;s done nobody any harm but himself and his
family,&mdash;the more&rsquo;s the pity,&mdash;and I go and look at the bare
shelves every day, and think where all my things used to stand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll bear it in mind,&rdquo; said Mr Wakem, hastily,
looking toward the open door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if you&rsquo;d please not to say as I&rsquo;ve been to speak to you,
for my son &rsquo;ud be very angry with me for demeaning myself, I know he
would, and I&rsquo;ve trouble enough without being scolded by my
children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s voice trembled a little, and she could make no
answer to the attorney&rsquo;s &ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; but curtsied and
walked out in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which day is it that Dorlcote Mill is to be sold? Where&rsquo;s the
bill?&rdquo; said Mr Wakem to his clerk when they were alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next Friday is the day,&mdash;Friday at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, just run to Winship&rsquo;s the auctioneer, and see if he&rsquo;s at
home. I have some business for him; ask him to come up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Although, when Mr Wakem entered his office that morning, he had had no
intention of purchasing Dorlcote Mill, his mind was already made up. Mrs
Tulliver had suggested to him several determining motives, and his mental
glance was very rapid; he was one of those men who can be prompt without being
rash, because their motives run in fixed tracks, and they have no need to
reconcile conflicting aims.
</p>

<p>
To suppose that Wakem had the same sort of inveterate hatred toward Tulliver
that Tulliver had toward him would be like supposing that a pike and a roach
can look at each other from a similar point of view. The roach necessarily
abhors the mode in which the pike gets his living, and the pike is likely to
think nothing further even of the most indignant roach than that he is
excellent good eating; it could only be when the roach choked him that the pike
could entertain a strong personal animosity. If Mr Tulliver had ever seriously
injured or thwarted the attorney, Wakem would not have refused him the
distinction of being a special object of his vindictiveness. But when Mr
Tulliver called Wakem a rascal at the market dinner-table, the attorneys&rsquo;
clients were not a whit inclined to withdraw their business from him; and if,
when Wakem himself happened to be present, some jocose cattle-feeder,
stimulated by opportunity and brandy, made a thrust at him by alluding to old
ladies&rsquo; wills, he maintained perfect <i>sang froid</i>, and knew quite
well that the majority of substantial men then present were perfectly contented
with the fact that &ldquo;Wakem was Wakem&rdquo;; that is to say, a man who
always knew the stepping-stones that would carry him through very muddy bits of
practice. A man who had made a large fortune, had a handsome house among the
trees at Tofton, and decidedly the finest stock of port-wine in the
neighbourhood of St Ogg&rsquo;s, was likely to feel himself on a level with
public opinion. And I am not sure that even honest Mr Tulliver himself, with
his general view of law as a cockpit, might not, under opposite circumstances,
have seen a fine appropriateness in the truth that &ldquo;Wakem was
Wakem&rdquo;; since I have understood from persons versed in history, that
mankind is not disposed to look narrowly into the conduct of great victors when
their victory is on the right side. Tulliver, then, could be no obstruction to
Wakem; on the contrary, he was a poor devil whom the lawyer had defeated
several times; a hot-tempered fellow, who would always give you a handle
against him. Wakem&rsquo;s conscience was not uneasy because he had used a few
tricks against the miller; why should he hate that unsuccessful plaintiff, that
pitiable, furious bull entangled in the meshes of a net?
</p>

<p>
Still, among the various excesses to which human nature is subject, moralists
have never numbered that of being too fond of the people who openly revile us.
The successful Yellow candidate for the borough of Old Topping, perhaps, feels
no pursuant meditative hatred toward the Blue editor who consoles his
subscribers with vituperative rhetoric against Yellow men who sell their
country, and are the demons of private life; but he might not be sorry, if law
and opportunity favoured, to kick that Blue editor to a deeper shade of his
favourite colour. Prosperous men take a little vengeance now and then, as they
take a diversion, when it comes easily in their way, and is no hindrance to
business; and such small unimpassioned revenges have an enormous effect in
life, running through all degrees of pleasant infliction, blocking the fit men
out of places, and blackening characters in unpremeditated talk. Still more, to
see people who have been only insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life
and humiliated, without any special effort of ours, is apt to have a soothing,
flattering influence. Providence or some other prince of this world, it
appears, has undertaken the task of retribution for us; and really, by an
agreeable constitution of things, our enemies somehow <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
prosper.
</p>

<p>
Wakem was not without this parenthetic vindictiveness toward the
uncomplimentary miller; and now Mrs Tulliver had put the notion into his head,
it presented itself to him as a pleasure to do the very thing that would cause
Mr Tulliver the most deadly mortification,&mdash;and a pleasure of a complex
kind, not made up of crude malice, but mingling with it the relish of
self-approbation. To see an enemy humiliated gives a certain contentment, but
this is jejune compared with the highly blent satisfaction of seeing him
humiliated by your benevolent action or concession on his behalf. That is a
sort of revenge which falls into the scale of virtue, and Wakem was not without
an intention of keeping that scale respectably filled. He had once had the
pleasure of putting an old enemy of his into one of the St Ogg&rsquo;s
alms-houses, to the rebuilding of which he had given a large subscription; and
here was an opportunity of providing for another by making him his own servant.
Such things give a completeness to prosperity, and contribute elements of
agreeable consciousness that are not dreamed of by that short-sighted,
overheated vindictiveness which goes out its way to wreak itself in direct
injury. And Tulliver, with his rough tongue filed by a sense of obligation,
would make a better servant than any chance-fellow who was cap-in-hand for a
situation. Tulliver was known to be a man of proud honesty, and Wakem was too
acute not to believe in the existence of honesty. He was given too observing
individuals, not to judging of them according to maxims, and no one knew better
than he that all men were not like himself. Besides, he intended to overlook
the whole business of land and mill pretty closely; he was fond of these
practical rural matters. But there were good reasons for purchasing Dorlcote
Mill, quite apart from any benevolent vengeance on the miller. It was really a
capital investment; besides, Guest &amp;Co. were going to bid for it. Mr Guest
and Mr Wakem were on friendly dining terms, and the attorney liked to
predominate over a ship-owner and mill-owner who was a little too loud in the
town affairs as well as in his table-talk. For Wakem was not a mere man of
business; he was considered a pleasant fellow in the upper circles of St
Ogg&rsquo;s&mdash;chatted amusingly over his port-wine, did a little amateur
farming, and had certainly been an excellent husband and father; at church,
when he went there, he sat under the handsomest of mural monuments erected to
the memory of his wife. Most men would have married again under his
circumstances, but he was said to be more tender to his deformed son than most
men were to their best-shapen offspring. Not that Mr Wakem had not other sons
beside Philip; but toward them he held only a chiaroscuro parentage, and
provided for them in a grade of life duly beneath his own. In this fact,
indeed, there lay the clenching motive to the purchase of Dorlcote Mill. While
Mrs Tulliver was talking, it had occurred to the rapid-minded lawyer, among
all the other circumstances of the case, that this purchase would, in a few
years to come, furnish a highly suitable position for a certain favourite lad
whom he meant to bring on in the world.
</p>

<p>
These were the mental conditions on which Mrs Tulliver had undertaken to act
persuasively, and had failed; a fact which may receive some illustration from
the remark of a great philosopher, that fly-fishers fail in preparing their
bait so as to make it alluring in the right quarter, for want of a due
acquaintance with the subjectivity of fishes.

<h3><a name="chap28"></a>Chapter VIII.<br/>
Daylight on the Wreck</h3>

<p>
It was a clear frosty January day on which Mr Tulliver first came downstairs.
The bright sun on the chestnut boughs and the roofs opposite his window had
made him impatiently declare that he would be caged up no longer; he thought
everywhere would be more cheery under this sunshine than his bedroom; for he
knew nothing of the bareness below, which made the flood of sunshine
importunate, as if it had an unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places,
and the marks where well-known objects once had been. The impression on his
mind that it was but yesterday when he received the letter from Mr Gore was so
continually implied in his talk, and the attempts to convey to him the idea
that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had been so soon
swept away by recurrent forgetfulness, that even Mr Turnbull had begun to
despair of preparing him to meet the facts by previous knowledge. The full
sense of the present could only be imparted gradually by new
experience,&mdash;not by mere words, which must remain weaker than the
impressions left by the <i>old</i> experience. This resolution to come
downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and children. Mrs Tulliver
said Tom must not go to St Ogg&rsquo;s at the usual hour, he must wait and see
his father downstairs; and Tom complied, though with an intense inward
shrinking from the painful scene. The hearts of all three had been more deeply
dejected than ever during the last few days. For Guest &amp;Co. had not bought
the mill; both mill and land had been knocked down to Wakem, who had been over
the premises, and had laid before Mr Deane and Mr Glegg, in Mrs
Tulliver&rsquo;s presence, his willingness to employ Mr Tulliver, in case of
his recovery, as a manager of the business. This proposition had occasioned
much family debating. Uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion that
such an offer ought not to be rejected when there was nothing in the way but a
feeling in Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s mind, which, as neither aunts nor uncles shared
it, was regarded as entirely unreasonable and childish,&mdash;indeed, as a
transferring toward Wakem of that indignation and hatred which Mr Tulliver
ought properly to have directed against himself for his general
quarrelsomeness, and his special exhibition of it in going to law. Here was an
opportunity for Mr Tulliver to provide for his wife and daughter without any
assistance from his wife&rsquo;s relations, and without that too evident
descent into pauperism which makes it annoying to respectable people to meet
the degraded member of the family by the wayside. Mr Tulliver, Mrs Glegg
considered, must be made to feel, when he came to his right mind, that he could
never humble himself enough; for <i>that</i> had come which she had always
foreseen would come of his insolence in time past &ldquo;to them as were the
best friends he&rsquo;d got to look to.&rdquo; Mr Glegg and Mr Deane were less
stern in their views, but they both of them thought Tulliver had done enough
harm by his hot-tempered crotchets and ought to put them out of the question
when a livelihood was offered him; Wakem showed a right feeling about the
matter,&mdash;<i>he</i> had no grudge against Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
Tom had protested against entertaining the proposition. He shouldn&rsquo;t like
his father to be under Wakem; he thought it would look mean-spirited; but his
mother&rsquo;s main distress was the utter impossibility of ever &ldquo;turning
Mr Tulliver round about Wakem,&rdquo; or getting him to hear reason; no, they
would all have to go and live in a pigsty on purpose to spite Wakem, who spoke
&ldquo;so as nobody could be fairer.&rdquo; Indeed, Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s mind
was reduced to such confusion by living in this strange medium of unaccountable
sorrow, against which she continually appealed by asking, &ldquo;Oh dear, what
<i>have</i> I done to deserve worse than other women?&rdquo; that Maggie began
to suspect her poor mother&rsquo;s wits were quite going.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said, when they were out of their father&rsquo;s room
together, &ldquo;we <i>must</i> try to make father understand a little of what
has happened before he goes downstairs. But we must get my mother away. She
will say something that will do harm. Ask Kezia to fetch her down, and keep her
engaged with something in the kitchen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kezia was equal to the task. Having declared her intention of staying till the
master could get about again, &ldquo;wage or no wage,&rdquo; she had found a
certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her mistress, scolding her for
&ldquo;moithering&rdquo; herself, and going about all day without changing her
cap, and looking as if she was &ldquo;mushed.&rdquo; Altogether, this time of
trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she could scold her betters
with unreproved freedom. On this particular occasion there were drying clothes
to be fetched in; she wished to know if one pair of hands could do everything
in-doors and out, and observed that <i>she</i> should have thought it would be
good for Mrs Tulliver to put on her bonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by
doing that needful piece of work. Poor Mrs Tulliver went submissively
downstairs; to be ordered about by a servant was the last remnant of her
household dignities,&mdash;she would soon have no servant to scold her. Mr
Tulliver was resting in his chair a little after the fatigue of dressing, and
Maggie and Tom were seated near him, when Luke entered to ask if he should help
master downstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Luke; stop a bit, sit down,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver pointing
his stick toward a chair, and looking at him with that pursuant gaze which
convalescent persons often have for those who have tended them, reminding one
of an infant gazing about after its nurse. For Luke had been a constant
night-watcher by his master&rsquo;s bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the water now, eh, Luke?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
&ldquo;Dix hasn&rsquo;t been choking you up again, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, I thought not; he won&rsquo;t be in a hurry at that again, now
Riley&rsquo;s been to settle him. That was what I said to Riley
yesterday&mdash;I said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver leaned forward, resting his elbows on the armchair, and looking on
the ground as if in search of something, striving after vanishing images like a
man struggling against a doze. Maggie looked at Tom in mute distress, their
father&rsquo;s mind was so far off the present, which would by-and-by thrust
itself on his wandering consciousness! Tom was almost ready to rush away, with
that impatience of painful emotion which makes one of the differences between
youth and maiden, man and woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Maggie, laying her hand on his, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you remember that Mr Riley is dead?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, sharply, looking in her face with a
strange, examining glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he died of apoplexy nearly a year ago. I remember hearing you say
you had to pay money for him; and he left his daughters badly off; one of them
is under-teacher at Miss Firniss&rsquo;s, where I&rsquo;ve been to school, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said her father, doubtfully, still looking in her face. But
as soon as Tom began to speak he turned to look at <i>him</i> with the same
inquiring glances, as if he were rather surprised at the presence of these two
young people. Whenever his mind was wandering in the far past, he fell into
this oblivion of their actual faces; they were not those of the lad and the
little wench who belonged to that past.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long while since you had the dispute with Dix,
father,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I remember your talking about it three years
ago, before I went to school at Mr Stelling&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve been at school
there three years; don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver threw himself backward again, losing the childlike outward glance
under a rush of new ideas, which diverted him from external impressions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; he said, after a minute or two, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve paid a
deal o&rsquo; money&mdash;I was determined my son should have a good
eddication; I&rsquo;d none myself, and I&rsquo;ve felt the miss of it. And
he&rsquo;ll want no other fortin, that&rsquo;s what I say&mdash;if Wakem was to
get the better of me again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The thought of Wakem roused new vibrations, and after a moment&rsquo;s pause he
began to look at the coat he had on, and to feel in his side-pocket. Then he
turned to Tom, and said in his old sharp way, &ldquo;Where have they put
Gore&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was close at hand in a drawer, for he had often asked for it before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know what there is in the letter, father?&rdquo; said Tom, as he
gave it to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure I do,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, rather angrily. &ldquo;What
o&rsquo; that? If Furley can&rsquo;t take to the property, somebody else can;
there&rsquo;s plenty o&rsquo; people in the world besides Furley. But
it&rsquo;s hindering&mdash;my not being well&mdash;go and tell &rsquo;em to get
the horse in the gig, Luke; I can get down to St Ogg&rsquo;s well
enough&mdash;Gore&rsquo;s expecting me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, dear father!&rdquo; Maggie burst out entreatingly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a very long while since all that; you&rsquo;ve been ill a great many
weeks,&mdash;more than two months; everything is changed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled gaze; the
idea that much had happened of which he knew nothing had often transiently
arrested him before, but it came upon him now with entire novelty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said Tom, in answer to the gaze. &ldquo;You
needn&rsquo;t trouble your mind about business until you are quite well;
everything is settled about that for the present,&mdash;about the mill and the
land and the debts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s settled, then?&rdquo; said his father, angrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take on too much bout it, sir,&rdquo; said Luke.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; paid iverybody if you could,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what I said to Master Tom,&mdash;I said you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; paid iverybody if
you could.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Good Luke felt, after the manner of contented hard-working men whose lives have
been spent in servitude, that sense of natural fitness in rank which made his
master&rsquo;s downfall a tragedy to him. He was urged, in his slow way, to say
something that would express his share in the family sorrow; and these words,
which he had used over and over again to Tom when he wanted to decline the full
payment of his fifty pounds out of the children&rsquo;s money, were the most
ready to his tongue. They were just the words to lay the most painful hold on
his master&rsquo;s bewildered mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Paid everybody?&rdquo; he said, with vehement agitation, his face
flushing, and his eye lighting up. &ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;have they made
me a <i>bankrupt?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, father, dear father!&rdquo; said Maggie, who thought that terrible
word really represented the fact; &ldquo;bear it well, because we love you;
your children will always love you. Tom will pay them all; he says he will,
when he&rsquo;s a man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She felt her father beginning to tremble; his voice trembled too, as he said,
after a few moments:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, my little wench, but I shall never live twice o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody, father,&rdquo; said
Tom, speaking with a great effort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my lad,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, shaking his head slowly,
&ldquo;but what&rsquo;s broke can never be whole again; it &rsquo;ud be your
doing, not mine.&rdquo; Then looking up at him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only
sixteen; it&rsquo;s an up-hill fight for you, but you mustn&rsquo;t throw it at
your father; the raskills have been too many for him. I&rsquo;ve given you a
good eddication,&mdash;that&rsquo;ll start you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Something in his throat half choked the last words; the flush, which had
alarmed his children because it had so often preceded a recurrence of
paralysis, had subsided, and his face looked pale and tremulous. Tom said
nothing; he was still struggling against his inclination to rush away. His
father remained quiet a minute or two, but his mind did not seem to be
wandering again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have they sold me up, then?&rdquo; he said more calmly, as if he were
possessed simply by the desire to know what had happened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everything is sold, father; but we don&rsquo;t know all about the mill
and the land yet,&rdquo; said Tom, anxious to ward off any question leading to
the fact that Wakem was the purchaser.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs,
father,&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s your chair and the bureau;
<i>they&rsquo;re</i> not gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go; help me down, Luke,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go and see
everything,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, leaning on his stick, and stretching out
his other hand toward Luke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; said Luke, as he gave his arm to his master,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll make up your mind to&rsquo;t a bit better when you&rsquo;ve
seen iverything; you&rsquo;ll get used to&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s what my mother
says about her shortness o&rsquo; breath,&mdash;she says she&rsquo;s made
friends wi&rsquo;t now, though she fought again&rsquo; it sore when it just
come on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie ran on before to see that all was right in the dreary parlour, where the
fire, dulled by the frosty sunshine, seemed part of the general shabbiness. She
turned her father&rsquo;s chair, and pushed aside the table to make an easy way
for him, and then stood with a beating heart to see him enter and look round
for the first time. Tom advanced before him, carrying the leg-rest, and stood
beside Maggie on the hearth. Of those two young hearts Tom&rsquo;s suffered the
most unmixed pain, for Maggie, with all her keen susceptibility, yet felt as if
the sorrow made larger room for her love to flow in, and gave breathing-space
to her passionate nature. No true boy feels that; he would rather go and slay
the Nemean lion, or perform any round of heroic labours, than endure perpetual
appeals to his pity, for evils over which he can make no conquest.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver paused just inside the door, resting on Luke, and looking round
him at all the bare places, which for him were filled with the shadows of
departed objects,&mdash;the daily companions of his life. His faculties seemed
to be renewing their strength from getting a footing on this demonstration of
the senses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said slowly, moving toward his chair, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve
sold me up&mdash;they&rsquo;ve sold me up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then seating himself, and laying down his stick, while Luke left the room, he
looked round again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve left the big Bible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got
everything in,&mdash;when I was born and married; bring it me, Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The quarto Bible was laid open before him at the fly-leaf, and while he was
reading with slowly travelling eyes Mrs Tulliver entered the room, but stood
in mute surprise to find her husband down already, and with the great Bible
before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, looking at a spot where his finger rested, &ldquo;my
mother was Margaret Beaton; she died when she was forty-seven,&mdash;hers
wasn&rsquo;t a long-lived family; we&rsquo;re our mother&rsquo;s children,
Gritty and me are,&mdash;we shall go to our last bed before long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be pausing over the record of his sister&rsquo;s birth and
marriage, as if it were suggesting new thoughts to him; then he suddenly looked
up at Tom, and said, in a sharp tone of alarm:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t come upo&rsquo; Moss for the money as I lent him,
have they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;the note was burnt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver turned his eyes on the page again, and presently said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;Elizabeth Dodson&mdash;it&rsquo;s eighteen year since I married
her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come next Ladyday,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, going up to his side and
looking at the page.
</p>

<p>
Her husband fixed his eyes earnestly on her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Bessy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you was a pretty lass
then,&mdash;everybody said so,&mdash;and I used to think you kept your good
looks rarely. But you&rsquo;re sorely aged; don&rsquo;t you bear me
ill-will&mdash;I meant to do well by you&mdash;we promised one another for
better or for worse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I never thought it &rsquo;ud be so for worse as this,&rdquo; said
poor Mrs Tulliver, with the strange, scared look that had come over her of
late; &ldquo;and my poor father gave me away&mdash;and to come on so all at
once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk in that
way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I know you won&rsquo;t let your poor mother speak&mdash;that&rsquo;s
been the way all my life&mdash;your father never minded what I said&mdash;it
&rsquo;ud have been o&rsquo; no use for me to beg and pray&mdash;and it
&rsquo;ud be no use now, not if I was to go down o&rsquo; my hands and
knees&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, Bessy,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, whose pride, in
these first moments of humiliation, was in abeyance to the sense of some
justice in his wife&rsquo;s reproach. &ldquo;It there&rsquo;s anything left as
I could do to make you amends, I wouldn&rsquo;t say you nay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we might stay here and get a living, and I might keep among my own
sisters,&mdash;and me been such a good wife to you, and never crossed you from
week&rsquo;s end to week&rsquo;s end&mdash;and they all say so&mdash;they say
it &rsquo;ud be nothing but right, only you&rsquo;re so turned against
Wakem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Tom, severely, &ldquo;this is not the time to talk
about that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let her be,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver. &ldquo;Say what you mean,
Bessy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, now the mill and the land&rsquo;s all Wakem&rsquo;s, and he&rsquo;s
got everything in his hands, what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; setting your face
against him, when he says you may stay here, and speaks as fair as can be, and
says you may manage the business, and have thirty shillings a-week, and a horse
to ride about to market? And where have we got to put our heads? We must go
into one o&rsquo; the cottages in the village,&mdash;and me and my children
brought down to that,&mdash;and all because you must set your mind against
folks till there&rsquo;s no turning you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver had sunk back in his chair trembling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may do as you like wi&rsquo; me, Bessy,&rdquo; he said, in a low
voice; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been the bringing of you to poverty&mdash;this
world&rsquo;s too many for me&mdash;I&rsquo;m nought but a bankrupt; it&rsquo;s
no use standing up for anything now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with my mother or my
uncles, and I don&rsquo;t think you ought to submit to be under Wakem. I get a
pound a-week now, and you can find something else to do when you get
well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say no more, Tom, say no more; I&rsquo;ve had enough for this day. Give
me a kiss, Bessy, and let us bear one another no ill-will; we shall never be
young again&mdash;this world&rsquo;s been too many for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap29"></a>Chapter IX.<br/>
An Item Added to the Family Register</h3>

<p>
That first moment of renunciation and submission was followed by days of
violent struggle in the miller&rsquo;s mind, as the gradual access of bodily
strength brought with it increasing ability to embrace in one view all the
conflicting conditions under which he found himself. Feeble limbs easily resign
themselves to be tethered, and when we are subdued by sickness it seems
possible to us to fulfil pledges which the old vigor comes back and breaks.
There were times when poor Tulliver thought the fulfilment of his promise to
Bessy was something quite too hard for human nature; he had promised her
without knowing what she was going to say,&mdash;she might as well have asked
him to carry a ton weight on his back. But again, there were many feelings
arguing on her side, besides the sense that life had been made hard to her by
having married him. He saw a possibility, by much pinching, of saving money out
of his salary toward paying a second dividend to his creditors, and it would
not be easy elsewhere to get a situation such as he could fill.
</p>

<p>
He had led an easy life, ordering much and working little, and had no aptitude
for any new business. He must perhaps take to day-labour, and his wife must
have help from her sisters,&mdash;a prospect doubly bitter to him, now they had
let all Bessy&rsquo;s precious things be sold, probably because they liked to
set her against him, by making her feel that he had brought her to that pass.
He listened to their admonitory talk, when they came to urge on him what he was
bound to do for poor Bessy&rsquo;s sake, with averted eyes, that every now and
then flashed on them furtively when their backs were turned. Nothing but the
dread of needing their help could have made it an easier alternative to take
their advice.
</p>

<p>
But the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises where he
had run about when he was a boy, just as Tom had done after him. The Tullivers
had lived on this spot for generations, and he had sat listening on a low stool
on winter evenings while his father talked of the old half-timbered mill that
had been there before the last great floods which damaged it so that his
grandfather pulled it down and built the new one. It was when he got able to
walk about and look at all the old objects that he felt the strain of his
clinging affection for the old home as part of his life, part of himself. He
couldn&rsquo;t bear to think of himself living on any other spot than this,
where he knew the sound of every gate door, and felt that the shape and colour
of every roof and weather-stain and broken hillock was good, because his
growing senses had been fed on them. Our instructed vagrancy, which was hardly
time to linger by the hedgerows, but runs away early to the tropics, and is at
home with palms and banyans,&mdash;which is nourished on books of travel and
stretches the theatre of its imagination to the Zambesi,&mdash;can hardly get a
dim notion of what an old-fashioned man like Tulliver felt for this spot, where
all his memories centred, and where life seemed like a familiar smooth-handled
tool that the fingers clutch with loving ease. And just now he was living in
that freshened memory of the far-off time which comes to us in the passive
hours of recovery from sickness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, Luke,&rdquo; he said one afternoon, as he stood looking over the
orchard gate, &ldquo;I remember the day they planted those apple-trees. My
father was a huge man for planting,&mdash;it was like a merry-making to him to
get a cart full o&rsquo; young trees; and I used to stand i&rsquo; the cold
with him, and follow him about like a dog.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he turned round, and leaning against the gate-post, looked at the opposite
buildings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The old mill &rsquo;ud miss me, I think, Luke. There&rsquo;s a story as
when the mill changes hands, the river&rsquo;s angry; I&rsquo;ve heard my
father say it many a time. There&rsquo;s no telling whether there mayn&rsquo;t
be summat <i>in</i> the story, for this is a puzzling world, and Old
Harry&rsquo;s got a finger in it&mdash;it&rsquo;s been too many for me, I
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; said Luke, with soothing sympathy, &ldquo;what wi&rsquo;
the rust on the wheat, an&rsquo; the firin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the ricks an&rsquo;
that, as I&rsquo;ve seen i&rsquo; my time,&mdash;things often looks comical;
there&rsquo;s the bacon fat wi&rsquo; our last pig run away like
butter,&mdash;it leaves nought but a scratchin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as if it was yesterday, now,&rdquo; Mr Tulliver went
on, &ldquo;when my father began the malting. I remember, the day they finished
the malt-house, I thought summat great was to come of it; for we&rsquo;d a
plum-pudding that day and a bit of a feast, and I said to my mother,&mdash;she
was a fine dark-eyed woman, my mother was,&mdash;the little wench &rsquo;ull be
as like her as two peas.&rdquo; Here Mr Tulliver put his stick between his
legs, and took out his snuff-box, for the greater enjoyment of this anecdote,
which dropped from him in fragments, as if he every other moment lost narration
in vision. &ldquo;I was a little chap no higher much than my mother&rsquo;s
knee,&mdash;she was sore fond of us children, Gritty and me,&mdash;and so I
said to her, &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;shall we have plum-pudding
<i>every</i> day because o&rsquo; the malt-house? She used to tell me o&rsquo;
that till her dying day. She was but a young woman when she died, my mother
was. But it&rsquo;s forty good year since they finished the malt-house, and it
isn&rsquo;t many days out of &rsquo;em all as I haven&rsquo;t looked out into
the yard there, the first thing in the morning,&mdash;all weathers, from
year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end. I should go off my head in a new place. I
should be like as if I&rsquo;d lost my way. It&rsquo;s all hard, whichever way
I look at it,&mdash;the harness &rsquo;ull gall me, but it &rsquo;ud be summat
to draw along the old road, instead of a new un.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; said Luke, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be a deal better here nor
in some new place. I can&rsquo;t abide new places mysen: things is allays
awk&rsquo;ard,&mdash;narrow-wheeled waggins, belike, and the stiles all another
sort, an&rsquo; oat-cake i&rsquo; some places, tow&rsquo;rt th&rsquo; head
o&rsquo; the Floss, there. It&rsquo;s poor work, changing your
country-side.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I doubt, Luke, they&rsquo;ll be for getting rid o&rsquo; Ben, and
making you do with a lad; and I must help a bit wi&rsquo; the mill.
You&rsquo;ll have a worse place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er mind, sir,&rdquo; said Luke, &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
plague mysen. I&rsquo;n been wi&rsquo; you twenty year, an&rsquo; you
can&rsquo;t get twenty year wi&rsquo; whistlin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em, no more
nor you can make the trees grow: you mun wait till God A&rsquo;mighty sends
&rsquo;em. I can&rsquo;t abide new victual nor new faces, <i>I</i>
can&rsquo;t,&mdash;you niver know but what they&rsquo;ll gripe you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The walk was finished in silence after this, for Luke had disburthened himself
of thoughts to an extent that left his conversational resources quite barren,
and Mr Tulliver had relapsed from his recollections into a painful meditation
on the choice of hardships before him. Maggie noticed that he was unusually
absent that evening at tea; and afterward he sat leaning forward in his chair,
looking at the ground, moving his lips, and shaking his head from time to time.
Then he looked hard at Mrs Tulliver, who was knitting opposite him, then at
Maggie, who, as she bent over her sewing, was intensely conscious of some drama
going forward in her father&rsquo;s mind. Suddenly he took up the poker and
broke the large coal fiercely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear heart, Mr Tulliver, what can you be thinking of?&rdquo; said his
wife, looking up in alarm; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very wasteful, breaking the coal,
and we&rsquo;ve got hardly any large coal left, and I don&rsquo;t know where
the rest is to come from.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re quite so well to-night, are you,
father?&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;you seem uneasy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, how is it Tom doesn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver,
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear heart! is it time? I must go and get his supper,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver, laying down her knitting, and leaving the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nigh upon half-past eight,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here soon. Go, go and get the big Bible, and open it at
the beginning, where everything&rsquo;s set down. And get the pen and
ink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie obeyed, wondering; but her father gave no further orders, and only sat
listening for Tom&rsquo;s footfall on the gravel, apparently irritated by the
wind, which had risen, and was roaring so as to drown all other sounds. There
was a strange light in his eyes that rather frightened Maggie; <i>she</i> began
to wish that Tom would come, too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There he is, then,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, in an excited way, when the
knock came at last. Maggie went to open the door, but her mother came out of
the kitchen hurriedly, saying, &ldquo;Stop a bit, Maggie; I&rsquo;ll open
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Tulliver had begun to be a little frightened at her boy, but she was
jealous of every office others did for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your supper&rsquo;s ready by the kitchen-fire, my boy,&rdquo; she said,
as he took off his hat and coat. &ldquo;You shall have it by yourself, just as
you like, and I won&rsquo;t speak to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think my father wants Tom, mother,&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;he must
come into the parlour first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom entered with his usual saddened evening face, but his eyes fell immediately
on the open Bible and the inkstand, and he glanced with a look of anxious
surprise at his father, who was saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, you&rsquo;re late; I want you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there anything the matter, father?&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You sit down, all of you,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, Tom, sit down here; I&rsquo;ve got something for you to write
i&rsquo; the Bible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They all three sat down, looking at him. He began to speak slowly, looking
first at his wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind, Bessy, and I&rsquo;ll be as good as my word
to you. There&rsquo;ll be the same grave made for us to lie down in, and we
mustn&rsquo;t be bearing one another ill-will. I&rsquo;ll stop in the old
place, and I&rsquo;ll serve under Wakem, and I&rsquo;ll serve him like an
honest man; there&rsquo;s no Tulliver but what&rsquo;s honest, mind that,
Tom,&rdquo;&mdash;here his voice rose,&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll have it to
throw up against me as I paid a dividend, but it wasn&rsquo;t my fault; it was
because there&rsquo;s raskills in the world. They&rsquo;ve been too many for
me, and I must give in. I&rsquo;ll put my neck in harness,&mdash;for
you&rsquo;ve a right to say as I&rsquo;ve brought you into trouble,
Bessy,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll serve him as honest as if he was no raskill;
I&rsquo;m an honest man, though I shall never hold my head up no more.
I&rsquo;m a tree as is broke&mdash;a tree as is broke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused and looked on the ground. Then suddenly raising his head, he said, in
a louder yet deeper tone:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t forgive him! I know what they say, he never meant me
any harm. That&rsquo;s the way Old Harry props up the rascals. He&rsquo;s been
at the bottom of everything; but he&rsquo;s a fine gentleman,&mdash;I know, I
know. I shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; gone to law, they say. But who made it so as
there was no arbitratin&rsquo;, and no justice to be got? It signifies nothing
to him, I know that; he&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; them fine gentlemen as get money
by doing business for poorer folks, and when he&rsquo;s made beggars of
&rsquo;em he&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em charity. I won&rsquo;t forgive him! I wish
he might be punished with shame till his own son &rsquo;ud like to forget him.
I wish he may do summat as they&rsquo;d make him work at the treadmill! But he
won&rsquo;t,&mdash;he&rsquo;s too big a raskill to let the law lay hold on him.
And you mind this, Tom,&mdash;you never forgive him neither, if you mean to be
my son. There&rsquo;ll maybe come a time when you may make him feel;
it&rsquo;ll never come to me; I&rsquo;n got my head under the yoke. Now
write&mdash;write it i&rsquo; the Bible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, father, what?&rdquo; said Maggie, sinking down by his knee, pale and
trembling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wicked to curse and bear malice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t wicked, I tell you,&rdquo; said her father, fiercely.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wicked as the raskills should prosper; it&rsquo;s the
Devil&rsquo;s doing. Do as I tell you, Tom. Write.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What am I to write?&rdquo; said Tom, with gloomy submission.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Write as your father, Edward Tulliver, took service under John Wakem,
the man as had helped to ruin him, because I&rsquo;d promised my wife to make
her what amends I could for her trouble, and because I wanted to die in
th&rsquo; old place where I was born and my father was born. Put that i&rsquo;
the right words&mdash;you know how&mdash;and then write, as I don&rsquo;t
forgive Wakem for all that; and for all I&rsquo;ll serve him honest, I wish
evil may befall him. Write that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a dead silence as Tom&rsquo;s pen moved along the paper; Mrs
Tulliver looked scared, and Maggie trembled like a leaf.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now let me hear what you&rsquo;ve wrote,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, Tom
read aloud slowly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now write&mdash;write as you&rsquo;ll remember what Wakem&rsquo;s done
to your father, and you&rsquo;ll make him and his feel it, if ever the day
comes. And sign your name Thomas Tulliver.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, father, dear father!&rdquo; said Maggie, almost choked with fear.
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t make Tom write that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be quiet, Maggie!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I <i>shall</i> write
it.&rdquo;

A Variation of Protestantism Unknown to Bossuet</h3>

<p>
Journeying down the Rhone on a summer&rsquo;s day, you have perhaps felt the
sunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in certain
parts of its course, telling how the swift river once rose, like an angry,
destroying god, sweeping down the feeble generations whose breath is in their
nostrils, and making their dwellings a desolation. Strange contrast, you may
have thought, between the effect produced on us by these dismal remnants of
commonplace houses, which in their best days were but the sign of a sordid
life, belonging in all its details to our own vulgar era, and the effect
produced by those ruins on the castled Rhine, which have crumbled and mellowed
into such harmony with the green and rocky steeps that they seem to have a
natural fitness, like the mountain-pine; nay, even in the day when they were
built they must have had this fitness, as if they had been raised by an
earth-born race, who had inherited from their mighty parent a sublime instinct
of form. And that was a day of romance; If those robber-barons were somewhat
grim and drunken ogres, they had a certain grandeur of the wild beast in
them,&mdash;they were forest boars with tusks, tearing and rending, not the
ordinary domestic grunter; they represented the demon forces forever in
collision with beauty, virtue, and the gentle uses of life; they made a fine
contrast in the picture with the wandering minstrel, the soft-lipped princess,
the pious recluse, and the timid Israelite. That was a time of colour, when the
sunlight fell on glancing steel and floating banners; a time of adventure and
fierce struggle,&mdash;nay, of living, religious art and religious enthusiasm;
for were not cathedrals built in those days, and did not great emperors leave
their Western palaces to die before the infidel strongholds in the sacred East?
Therefore it is that these Rhine castles thrill me with a sense of poetry; they
belong to the grand historic life of humanity, and raise up for me the vision
of an echo. But these dead-tinted, hollow-eyed, angular skeletons of villages
on the Rhone oppress me with the feeling that human life&mdash;very much of
it&mdash;is a narrow, ugly, grovelling existence, which even calamity does not
elevate, but rather tends to exhibit in all its bare vulgarity of conception;
and I have a cruel conviction that the lives these ruins are the traces of were
part of a gross sum of obscure vitality, that will be swept into the same
oblivion with the generations of ants and beavers.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed upon you in
watching this old-fashioned family life on the banks of the Floss, which even
sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the tragi-comic. It is a
sordid life, you say, this of the Tullivers and Dodsons, irradiated by no
sublime principles, no romantic visions, no active, self-renouncing faith;
moved by none of those wild, uncontrollable passions which create the dark
shadows of misery and crime; without that primitive, rough simplicity of wants,
that hard, submissive, ill-paid toil, that childlike spelling-out of what
nature has written, which gives its poetry to peasant life. Here one has
conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without polish,
surely the most prosaic form of human life; proud respectability in a gig of
unfashionable build; worldliness without side-dishes. Observing these people
narrowly, even when the iron hand of misfortune has shaken them from their
unquestioning hold on the world, one sees little trace of religion, still less
of a distinctively Christian creed. Their belief in the Unseen, so far as it
manifests itself at all, seems to be rather a pagan kind; their moral notions,
though held with strong tenacity, seem to have no standard beyond hereditary
custom. You could not live among such people; you are stifled for want of an
outlet toward something beautiful, great, or noble; you are irritated with
these dull men and women, as a kind of population out of keeping with the earth
on which they live,&mdash;with this rich plain where the great river flows
forever onward, and links the small pulse of the old English town with the
beatings of the world&rsquo;s mighty heart. A vigorous superstition, that
lashes its gods or lashes its own back, seems to be more congruous with the
mystery of the human lot, than the mental condition of these emmet-like Dodsons
and Tullivers.
</p>

<p>
I share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness; but it is necessary that
we should feel it, if we care to understand how it acted on the lives of Tom
and Maggie,&mdash;how it has acted on young natures in many generations, that
in the onward tendency of human things have risen above the mental level of the
generation before them, to which they have been nevertheless tied by the
strongest fibres of their hearts. The suffering, whether of martyr or victim,
which belongs to every historical advance of mankind, is represented in this
way in every town, and by hundreds of obscure hearths; and we need not shrink
from this comparison of small things with great; for does not science tell us
that its highest striving is after the ascertainment of a unity which shall
bind the smallest things with the greatest? In natural science, I have
understood, there is nothing petty to the mind that has a large vision of
relations, and to which every single object suggests a vast sum of conditions.
It is surely the same with the observation of human life.
</p>

<p>
Certainly the religious and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers were of
too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively, from the statement that they
were part of the Protestant population of Great Britain. Their theory of life
had its core of soundness, as all theories must have on which decent and
prosperous families have been reared and have flourished; but it had the very
slightest tincture of theology. If, in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters,
their Bibles opened more easily at some parts than others, it was because of
dried tulip-petals, which had been distributed quite impartially, without
preference for the historical, devotional, or doctrinal. Their religion was of
a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in it,&mdash;if heresy
properly means choice,&mdash;for they didn&rsquo;t know there was any other
religion, except that of chapel-goers, which appeared to run in families, like
asthma. How <i>should</i> they know? The vicar of their pleasant rural parish
was not a controversialist, but a good hand at whist, and one who had a joke
always ready for a blooming female parishioner. The religion of the Dodsons
consisted in revering whatever was customary and respectable; it was necessary
to be baptised, else one could not be buried in the church-yard, and to take
the sacrament before death, as a security against more dimly understood perils;
but it was of equal necessity to have the proper pall-bearers and well-cured
hams at one&rsquo;s funeral, and to leave an unimpeachable will. A Dodson would
not be taxed with the omission of anything that was becoming, or that belonged
to that eternal fitness of things which was plainly indicated in the practice
of the most substantial parishioners, and in the family traditions,&mdash;such
as obedience to parents, faithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid honesty,
thrift, the thorough scouring of wooden and copper utensils, the hoarding of
coins likely to disappear from the currency, the production of first-rate
commodities for the market, and the general preference of whatever was
home-made. The Dodsons were a very proud race, and their pride lay in the utter
frustration of all desire to tax them with a breach of traditional duty or
propriety. A wholesome pride in many respects, since it identified honour with
perfect integrity, thoroughness of work, and faithfulness to admitted rules;
and society owes some worthy qualities in many of her members to mothers of the
Dodson class, who made their butter and their fromenty well, and would have
felt disgraced to make it otherwise. To be honest and poor was never a Dodson
motto, still less to seem rich though being poor; rather, the family badge was
to be honest and rich, and not only rich, but richer than was supposed. To live
respected, and have the proper bearers at your funeral, was an achievement of
the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified if, on the reading of
your will, you sank in the opinion of your fellow-men, either by turning out to
be poorer than they expected, or by leaving your money in a capricious manner,
without strict regard to degrees of kin. The right thing must always be done
toward kindred. The right thing was to correct them severely, if they were
other than a credit to the family, but still not to alienate from them the
smallest rightful share in the family shoebuckles and other property. A
conspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its genuineness; its vices and
virtues alike were phases of a proud honest egoism, which had a hearty dislike
to whatever made against its own credit and interest, and would be frankly hard
of speech to inconvenient &ldquo;kin,&rdquo; but would never forsake or ignore
them,&mdash;would not let them want bread, but only require them to eat it with
bitter herbs.
</p>

<p>
The same sort of traditional belief ran in the Tulliver veins, but it was
carried in richer blood, having elements of generous imprudence, warm
affection, and hot-tempered rashness. Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s grandfather had been
heard to say that he was descended from one Ralph Tulliver, a wonderfully
clever fellow, who had ruined himself. It is likely enough that the clever
Ralph was a high liver, rode spirited horses, and was very decidedly of his own
opinion. On the other hand, nobody had ever heard of a Dodson who had ruined
himself; it was not the way of that family.
</p>

<p>
If such were the views of life on which the Dodsons and Tullivers had been
reared in the praiseworthy past of Pitt and high prices, you will infer from
what you already know concerning the state of society in St Ogg&rsquo;s, that
there had been no highly modifying influence to act on them in their maturer
life. It was still possible, even in that later time of anti-Catholic
preaching, for people to hold many pagan ideas, and believe themselves good
church-people, notwithstanding; so we need hardly feel any surprise at the fact
that Mr Tulliver, though a regular church-goer, recorded his vindictiveness on
the fly-leaf of his Bible. It was not that any harm could be said concerning
the vicar of that charming rural parish to which Dorlcote Mill belonged; he was
a man of excellent family, an irreproachable bachelor, of elegant
pursuits,&mdash;had taken honours, and held a fellowship. Mr Tulliver regarded
him with dutiful respect, as he did everything else belonging to the
church-service; but he considered that church was one thing and common-sense
another, and he wanted nobody to tell <i>him</i> what commonsense was. Certain
seeds which are required to find a nidus for themselves under unfavourable
circumstances have been supplied by nature with an apparatus of hooks, so that
they will get a hold on very unreceptive surfaces. The spiritual seed which had
been scattered over Mr Tulliver had apparently been destitute of any
corresponding provision, and had slipped off to the winds again, from a total
absence of hooks.

The Torn Nest Is Pierced by the Thorns</h3>

<p>
There is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies the first
shocks of trouble, just as an acute pain is often a stimulus, and produces an
excitement which is transient strength. It is in the slow, changed life that
follows; in the time when sorrow has become stale, and has no longer an emotive
intensity that counteracts its pain; in the time when day follows day in dull,
unexpectant sameness, and trial is a dreary routine,&mdash;it is then that
despair threatens; it is then that the peremptory hunger of the soul is felt,
and eye and ear are strained after some unlearned secret of our existence,
which shall give to endurance the nature of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
This time of utmost need was come to Maggie, with her short span of thirteen
years. To the usual precocity of the girl, she added that early experience of
struggle, of conflict between the inward impulse and outward fact, which is the
lot of every imaginative and passionate nature; and the years since she
hammered the nails into her wooden Fetish among the worm-eaten shelves of the
attic had been filled with so eager a life in the triple world of Reality,
Books, and Waking Dreams, that Maggie was strangely old for her years in
everything except in her entire want of that prudence and self-command which
were the qualities that made Tom manly in the midst of his intellectual
boyishness. And now her lot was beginning to have a still, sad monotony, which
threw her more than ever on her inward self. Her father was able to attend to
business again, his affairs were settled, and he was acting as Wakem&rsquo;s
manager on the old spot. Tom went to and fro every morning and evening, and
became more and more silent in the short intervals at home; what was there to
say? One day was like another; and Tom&rsquo;s interest in life, driven back
and crushed on every other side, was concentrating itself into the one channel
of ambitious resistance to misfortune. The peculiarities of his father and
mother were very irksome to him, now they were laid bare of all the softening
accompaniments of an easy, prosperous home; for Tom had very clear, prosaic
eyes, not apt to be dimmed by mists of feeling or imagination. Poor Mrs
Tulliver, it seemed, would never recover her old self, her placid household
activity; how could she? The objects among which her mind had moved
complacently were all gone,&mdash;all the little hopes and schemes and
speculations, all the pleasant little cares about her treasures which had made
the world quite comprehensible to her for a quarter of a century, since she had
made her first purchase of the sugar-tongs, had been suddenly snatched away
from her, and she remained bewildered in this empty life. Why that should have
happened to her which had not happened to other women remained an insoluble
question by which she expressed her perpetual ruminating comparison of the past
with the present. It was piteous to see the comely woman getting thinner and
more worn under a bodily as well as mental restlessness, which made her often
wander about the empty house after her work was done, until Maggie, becoming
alarmed about her, would seek her, and bring her down by telling her how it
vexed Tom that she was injuring her health by never sitting down and resting
herself. Yet amidst this helpless imbecility there was a touching trait of
humble, self-devoting maternity, which made Maggie feel tenderly toward her
poor mother amidst all the little wearing griefs caused by her mental
feebleness. She would let Maggie do none of the work that was heaviest and most
soiling to the hands, and was quite peevish when Maggie attempted to relieve
her from her grate-brushing and scouring: &ldquo;Let it alone, my dear; your
hands &rsquo;ull get as hard as hard,&rdquo; she would say; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
your mother&rsquo;s place to do that. I can&rsquo;t do the sewing&mdash;my eyes
fail me.&rdquo; And she would still brush and carefully tend Maggie&rsquo;s
hair, which she had become reconciled to, in spite of its refusal to curl, now
it was so long and massy. Maggie was not her pet child, and, in general, would
have been much better if she had been quite different; yet the womanly heart,
so bruised in its small personal desires, found a future to rest on in the life
of this young thing, and the mother pleased herself with wearing out her own
hands to save the hands that had so much more life in them.
</p>

<p>
But the constant presence of her mother&rsquo;s regretful bewilderment was less
painful to Maggie than that of her father&rsquo;s sullen, incommunicative
depression. As long as the paralysis was upon him, and it seemed as if he might
always be in a childlike condition of dependence,&mdash;as long as he was still
only half awakened to his trouble,&mdash;Maggie had felt the strong tide of
pitying love almost as an inspiration, a new power, that would make the most
difficult life easy for his sake; but now, instead of childlike dependence,
there had come a taciturn, hard concentration of purpose, in strange contrast
with his old vehement communicativeness and high spirit; and this lasted from
day to day, and from week to week, the dull eye never brightening with any
eagerness or any joy. It is something cruelly incomprehensible to youthful
natures, this sombre sameness in middle-aged and elderly people, whose life has
resulted in disappointment and discontent, to whose faces a smile becomes so
strange that the sad lines all about the lips and brow seem to take no notice
of it, and it hurries away again for want of a welcome. &ldquo;Why will they
not kindle up and be glad sometimes?&rdquo; thinks young elasticity. &ldquo;It
would be so easy if they only liked to do it.&rdquo; And these leaden clouds
that never part are apt to create impatience even in the filial affection that
streams forth in nothing but tenderness and pity in the time of more obvious
affliction.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver lingered nowhere away from home; he hurried away from market, he
refused all invitations to stay and chat, as in old times, in the houses where
he called on business. He could not be reconciled with his lot. There was no
attitude in which his pride did not feel its bruises; and in all behaviour
toward him, whether kind or cold, he detected an allusion to the change in his
circumstances. Even the days on which Wakem came to ride round the land and
inquire into the business were not so black to him as those market-days on
which he had met several creditors who had accepted a composition from him. To
save something toward the repayment of those creditors was the object toward
which he was now bending all his thoughts and efforts; and under the influence
of this all-compelling demand of his nature, the somewhat profuse man, who
hated to be stinted or to stint any one else in his own house, was gradually
metamorphosed into the keen-eyed grudger of morsels. Mrs Tulliver could not
economise enough to satisfy him, in their food and firing; and he would eat
nothing himself but what was of the coarsest quality. Tom, though depressed and
strongly repelled by his father&rsquo;s sullenness, and the dreariness of home,
entered thoroughly into his father&rsquo;s feelings about paying the creditors;
and the poor lad brought his first quarter&rsquo;s money, with a delicious
sense of achievement, and gave it to his father to put into the tin box which
held the savings. The little store of sovereigns in the tin box seemed to be
the only sight that brought a faint beam of pleasure into the miller&rsquo;s
eyes,&mdash;faint and transient, for it was soon dispelled by the thought that
the time would be long&mdash;perhaps longer than his life,&mdash;before the
narrow savings could remove the hateful incubus of debt. A deficit of more than
five hundred pounds, with the accumulating interest, seemed a deep pit to fill
with the savings from thirty shillings a-week, even when Tom&rsquo;s probable
savings were to be added. On this one point there was entire community of
feeling in the four widely differing beings who sat round the dying fire of
sticks, which made a cheap warmth for them on the verge of bedtime. Mrs
Tulliver carried the proud integrity of the Dodsons in her blood, and had been
brought up to think that to wrong people of their money, which was another
phrase for debt, was a sort of moral pillory; it would have been wickedness, to
her mind, to have run counter to her husband&rsquo;s desire to &ldquo;do the
right thing,&rdquo; and retrieve his name. She had a confused, dreamy notion
that, if the creditors were all paid, her plate and linen ought to come back to
her; but she had an inbred perception that while people owed money they were
unable to pay, they couldn&rsquo;t rightly call anything their own. She
murmured a little that Mr Tulliver so peremptorily refused to receive anything
in repayment from Mr and Mrs Moss; but to all his requirements of household
economy she was submissive to the point of denying herself the cheapest
indulgences of mere flavour; her only rebellion was to smuggle into the kitchen
something that would make rather a better supper than usual for Tom.
</p>

<p>
These narrow notions about debt, held by the old fashioned Tullivers, may
perhaps excite a smile on the faces of many readers in these days of wide
commercial views and wide philosophy, according to which everything rights
itself without any trouble of ours. The fact that my tradesman is out of pocket
by me is to be looked at through the serene certainty that somebody
else&rsquo;s tradesman is in pocket by somebody else; and since there must be
bad debts in the world, why, it is mere egoism not to like that we in
particular should make them instead of our fellow-citizens. I am telling the
history of very simple people, who had never had any illuminating doubts as to
personal integrity and honour.
</p>

<p>
Under all this grim melancholy and narrowing concentration of desire, Mr
Tulliver retained the feeling toward his &ldquo;little wench&rdquo; which made
her presence a need to him, though it would not suffice to cheer him. She was
still the desire of his eyes; but the sweet spring of fatherly love was now
mingled with bitterness, like everything else. When Maggie laid down her work
at night, it was her habit to get a low stool and sit by her father&rsquo;s
knee, leaning her cheek against it. How she wished he would stroke her head, or
give some sign that he was soothed by the sense that he had a daughter who
loved him! But now she got no answer to her little caresses, either from her
father or from Tom,&mdash;the two idols of her life. Tom was weary and
abstracted in the short intervals when he was at home, and her father was
bitterly preoccupied with the thought that the girl was growing up, was
shooting up into a woman; and how was she to do well in life? She had a poor
chance for marrying, down in the world as they were. And he hated the thought
of her marrying poorly, as her aunt Gritty had done; <i>that</i> would be a
thing to make him turn in his grave,&mdash;the little wench so pulled down by
children and toil, as her aunt Moss was. When uncultured minds, confined to a
narrow range of personal experience, are under the pressure of continued
misfortune, their inward life is apt to become a perpetually repeated round of
sad and bitter thoughts; the same words, the same scenes, are revolved over and
over again, the same mood accompanies them; the end of the year finds them as
much what they were at the beginning as if they were machines set to a
recurrent series of movements.
</p>

<p>
The sameness of the days was broken by few visitors. Uncles and aunts paid only
short visits now; of course, they could not stay to meals, and the constraint
caused by Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s savage silence, which seemed to add to the
hollow resonance of the bare, uncarpeted room when the aunts were talking,
heightened the unpleasantness of these family visits on all sides, and tended
to make them rare. As for other acquaintances, there is a chill air surrounding
those who are down in the world, and people are glad to get away from them, as
from a cold room; human beings, mere men and women, without furniture, without
anything to offer you, who have ceased to count as anybody, present an
embarrassing negation of reasons for wishing to see them, or of subjects on
which to converse with them. At that distant day, there was a dreary isolation
in the civilised Christian society of these realms for families that had
dropped below their original level, unless they belonged to a sectarian church,
which gets some warmth of brotherhood by walling in the sacred fire.

<h3><a name="chap32"></a>Chapter III.<br/>
A Voice from the Past</h3>

<p>
One afternoon, when the chestnuts were coming into flower, Maggie had brought
her chair outside the front door, and was seated there with a book on her
knees. Her dark eyes had wandered from the book, but they did not seem to be
enjoying the sunshine which pierced the screen of jasmine on the projecting
porch at her right, and threw leafy shadows on her pale round cheek; they
seemed rather to be searching for something that was not disclosed by the
sunshine. It had been a more miserable day than usual; her father, after a
visit of Wakem&rsquo;s had had a paroxysm of rage, in which for some trifling
fault he had beaten the boy who served in the mill. Once before, since his
illness, he had had a similar paroxysm, in which he had beaten his horse, and
the scene had left a lasting terror in Maggie&rsquo;s mind. The thought had
risen, that some time or other he might beat her mother if she happened to
speak in her feeble way at the wrong moment. The keenest of all dread with her
was lest her father should add to his present misfortune the wretchedness of
doing something irretrievably disgraceful. The battered school-book of
Tom&rsquo;s which she held on her knees could give her no fortitude under the
pressure of that dread; and again and again her eyes had filled with tears, as
they wandered vaguely, seeing neither the chestnut-trees, nor the distant
horizon, but only future scenes of home-sorrow.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of footsteps on
the gravel. It was not Tom who was entering, but a man in a sealskin cap and a
blue plush waistcoat, carrying a pack on his back, and followed closely by a
bullterrier of brindled coat and defiant aspect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Bob, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; said Maggie, starting up with a smile of
pleased recognition, for there had been no abundance of kind acts to efface the
recollection of Bob&rsquo;s generosity; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob, lifting his cap and showing a
delighted face, but immediately relieving himself of some accompanying
embarrassment by looking down at his dog, and saying in a tone of disgust,
&ldquo;Get out wi&rsquo; you, you thunderin&rsquo; sawney!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My brother is not at home yet, Bob,&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;he is
always at St Ogg&rsquo;s in the daytime.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I should be glad to see Mr Tom, but
that isn&rsquo;t just what I&rsquo;m come for,&mdash;look here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob was in the act of depositing his pack on the door-step, and with it a row
of small books fastened together with string.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, however, they were not the object to which he wished to call
Maggie&rsquo;s attention, but rather something which he had carried under his
arm, wrapped in a red handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; he said again, laying the red parcel on the others and
unfolding it; &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a-makin&rsquo; too free,
Miss, I hope, but I lighted on these books, and I thought they might make up to
you a bit for them as you&rsquo;ve lost; for I heared you speak o&rsquo;
picturs,&mdash;an&rsquo; as for picturs, <i>look</i> here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The opening of the red handkerchief had disclosed a superannuated
&ldquo;Keepsake&rdquo; and six or seven numbers of a &ldquo;Portrait
Gallery,&rdquo; in royal octavo; and the emphatic request to look referred to a
portrait of George the Fourth in all the majesty of his depressed cranium and
voluminous neckcloth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s all sorts o&rsquo; genelmen here,&rdquo; Bob went on,
turning over the leaves with some excitement, &ldquo;wi&rsquo; all sorts
o&rsquo; nones,&mdash;an&rsquo; some bald an&rsquo; some wi&rsquo;
wigs,&mdash;Parlament genelmen, I reckon. An&rsquo; here,&rdquo; he added,
opening the &ldquo;Keepsake,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>here&rsquo;s</i> ladies for
you, some wi&rsquo; curly hair and some wi&rsquo; smooth, an&rsquo; some
a-smiling wi&rsquo; their heads o&rsquo; one side, an&rsquo; some as if they
were goin&rsquo; to cry,&mdash;look here,&mdash;a-sittin&rsquo; on the ground
out o&rsquo; door, dressed like the ladies I&rsquo;n seen get out o&rsquo; the
carriages at the balls in th&rsquo; Old Hall there. My eyes! I wonder what the
chaps wear as go a-courtin&rsquo; &rsquo;em! I sot up till the clock was gone
twelve last night, a-lookin&rsquo; at &rsquo;em,&mdash;I did,&mdash;till they
stared at me out o&rsquo; the picturs as if they&rsquo;d know when I spoke to
&rsquo;em. But, lors! I shouldn&rsquo;t know what to say to &rsquo;em.
They&rsquo;ll be more fittin&rsquo; company for you, Miss; and the man at the
book-stall, he said they banged iverything for picturs; he said they was a
fust-rate article.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve bought them for me, Bob?&rdquo; said Maggie, deeply
touched by this simple kindness. &ldquo;How very, very good of you! But
I&rsquo;m afraid you gave a great deal of money for them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; gev three times the
money if they&rsquo;ll make up to you a bit for them as was sold away from you,
Miss. For I&rsquo;n niver forgot how you looked when you fretted about the
books bein&rsquo; gone; it&rsquo;s stuck by me as if it was a pictur
hingin&rsquo; before me. An&rsquo; when I see&rsquo;d the book open upo&rsquo;
the stall, wi&rsquo; the lady lookin&rsquo; out of it wi&rsquo; eyes a bit like
your&rsquo;n when you was frettin&rsquo;,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll excuse my
takin&rsquo; the liberty, Miss,&mdash;I thought I&rsquo;d make free to buy it
for you, an&rsquo; then I bought the books full o&rsquo; genelmen to match;
an&rsquo; then&rdquo;&mdash;here Bob took up the small stringed packet of
books&mdash;&ldquo;I thought you might like a bit more print as well as the
picturs, an&rsquo; I got these for a sayso,&mdash;they&rsquo;re cram-full
o&rsquo; print, an&rsquo; I thought they&rsquo;d do no harm comin&rsquo; along
wi&rsquo; these bettermost books. An&rsquo; I hope you won&rsquo;t say me nay,
an&rsquo; tell me as you won&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em, like Mr Tom did wi&rsquo;
the suvreigns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, Bob,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very thankful to
you for thinking of me, and being so good to me and Tom. I don&rsquo;t think
any one ever did such a kind thing for me before. I haven&rsquo;t many friends
who care for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hev a dog, Miss!&mdash;they&rsquo;re better friends nor any
Christian,&rdquo; said Bob, laying down his pack again, which he had taken up
with the intention of hurrying away; for he felt considerable shyness in
talking to a young lass like Maggie, though, as he usually said of himself,
&ldquo;his tongue overrun him&rdquo; when he began to speak. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t give you Mumps, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;d break his heart to go away
from me&mdash;eh, Mumps, what do you say, you riff-raff?&rdquo; (Mumps declined
to express himself more diffusely than by a single affirmative movement of his
tail.) &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d get you a pup, Miss, an&rsquo; welcome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you, Bob. We have a yard dog, and I mayn&rsquo;t keep a dog of
my own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, that&rsquo;s a pity; else there&rsquo;s a pup,&mdash;if you
didn&rsquo;t mind about it not being thoroughbred; its mother acts in the Punch
show,&mdash;an uncommon sensible bitch; she means more sense wi&rsquo; her bark
nor half the chaps can put into their talk from breakfast to sundown.
There&rsquo;s one chap carries pots,&mdash;a poor, low trade as any on the
road,&mdash;he says, &lsquo;Why Toby&rsquo;s nought but a mongrel;
there&rsquo;s nought to look at in her.&rsquo; But I says to him, &lsquo;Why,
what are you yoursen but a mongrel? There wasn&rsquo;t much pickin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; <i>your</i> feyther an&rsquo; mother, to look at you.&rsquo; Not but I
like a bit o&rsquo; breed myself, but I can&rsquo;t abide to see one cur
grinnin&rsquo; at another. I wish you good evenin&rsquo;, Miss,&rdquo; said
Bob, abruptly taking up his pack again, under the consciousness that his tongue
was acting in an undisciplined manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in the evening some time, and see my brother,
Bob?&rdquo; said Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Miss, thank you&mdash;another time. You&rsquo;ll give my duty to
him, if you please. Eh, he&rsquo;s a fine growed chap, Mr Tom is; he took to
growin&rsquo; i&rsquo; the legs, an&rsquo; <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The pack was down again, now, the hook of the stick having somehow gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call Mumps a cur, I suppose?&rdquo; said Maggie,
divining that any interest she showed in Mumps would be gratifying to his
master.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Miss, a fine way off that,&rdquo; said Bob, with pitying smile;
&ldquo;Mumps is as fine a cross as you&rsquo;ll see anywhere along the Floss,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;n been up it wi&rsquo; the barge times enow. Why, the gentry
stops to look at him; but you won&rsquo;t catch Mumps a-looking at the gentry
much,&mdash;he minds his own business, he does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The expression of Mump&rsquo;s face, which seemed to be tolerating the
superfluous existence of objects in general, was strongly confirmatory of this
high praise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He looks dreadfully surly,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;Would he let me
pat him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, that would he, and thank you. He knows his company, Mumps does. He
isn&rsquo;t a dog as &rsquo;ull be caught wi&rsquo; gingerbread; he&rsquo;d
smell a thief a good deal stronger nor the gingerbread, he would. Lors, I talk
to him by th&rsquo; hour together, when I&rsquo;m walking i&rsquo; lone places,
and if I&rsquo;n done a bit o&rsquo; mischief, I allays tell him. I&rsquo;n got
no secrets but what Mumps knows &rsquo;em. He knows about my big thumb, he
does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your big thumb&mdash;what&rsquo;s that, Bob?&rdquo; said Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob, quickly, exhibiting a
singularly broad specimen of that difference between the man and the monkey.
&ldquo;It tells i&rsquo; measuring out the flannel, you see. I carry flannel,
&rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s light for my pack, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s dear stuff, you
see, so a big thumb tells. I clap my thumb at the end o&rsquo; the yard and cut
o&rsquo; the hither side of it, and the old women aren&rsquo;t up
to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Bob,&rdquo; said Maggie, looking serious, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
cheating; I don&rsquo;t like to hear you say that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, Miss?&rdquo; said Bob regretfully. &ldquo;Then
I&rsquo;m sorry I said it. But I&rsquo;m so used to talking to Mumps, an&rsquo;
he doesn&rsquo;t mind a bit o&rsquo; cheating, when it&rsquo;s them skinflint
women, as haggle an&rsquo; haggle, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ud like to get their
flannel for nothing, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ud niver ask theirselves how I got my
dinner out on&rsquo;t. I niver cheat anybody as doesn&rsquo;t want to cheat me,
Miss,&mdash;lors, I&rsquo;m a honest chap, I am; only I must hev a bit o&rsquo;
sport, an&rsquo; now I don&rsquo;t go wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; ferrets, I&rsquo;n
got no varmint to come over but them haggling women. I wish you good evening,
Miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-by, Bob. Thank you very much for bringing me the books. And come
again to see Tom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob, moving on a few steps; then turning half
round he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave off that trick wi&rsquo; my big thumb,
if you don&rsquo;t think well on me for it, Miss; but it &rsquo;ud be a pity,
it would. I couldn&rsquo;t find another trick so good,&mdash;an&rsquo; what
&rsquo;ud be the use o&rsquo; havin&rsquo; a big thumb? It might as well
ha&rsquo; been narrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie, thus exalted into Bob&rsquo;s exalting Madonna, laughed in spite of
herself; at which her worshipper&rsquo;s blue eyes twinkled too, and under
these favouring auspices he touched his cap and walked away.
</p>

<p>
The days of chivalry are not gone, notwithstanding Burke&rsquo;s grand dirge
over them; they live still in that far-off worship paid by many a youth and man
to the woman of whom he never dreams that he shall touch so much as her little
finger or the hem of her robe. Bob, with the pack on his back, had as
respectful an adoration for this dark-eyed maiden as if he had been a knight in
armor calling aloud on her name as he pricked on to the fight.
</p>

<p>
That gleam of merriment soon died away from Maggie&rsquo;s face, and perhaps
only made the returning gloom deeper by contrast. She was too dispirited even
to like answering questions about Bob&rsquo;s present of books, and she carried
them away to her bedroom, laying them down there and seating herself on her one
stool, without caring to look at them just yet. She leaned her cheek against
the window-frame, and thought that the light-hearted Bob had a lot much happier
than hers.
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s sense of loneliness, and utter privation of joy, had deepened
with the brightness of advancing spring. All the favourite outdoor nooks about
home, which seemed to have done their part with her parents in nurturing and
cherishing her, were now mixed up with the home-sadness, and gathered no smile
from the sunshine. Every affection, every delight the poor child had had, was
like an aching nerve to her. There was no music for her any more,&mdash;no
piano, no harmonised voices, no delicious stringed instruments, with their
passionate cries of imprisoned spirits sending a strange vibration through her
frame. And of all her school-life there was nothing left her now but her little
collection of school-books, which she turned over with a sickening sense that
she knew them all, and they were all barren of comfort. Even at school she had
often wished for books with <i>more</i> in them; everything she learned there
seemed like the ends of long threads that snapped immediately. And
now&mdash;without the indirect charm of school-emulation&mdash;Télémaque was
mere bran; so were the hard, dry questions on Christian Doctrine; there was no
flavour in them, no strength. Sometimes Maggie thought she could have been
contented with absorbing fancies; if she could have had all Scott&rsquo;s
novels and all Byron&rsquo;s poems!&mdash;then, perhaps, she might have found
happiness enough to dull her sensibility to her actual daily life. And yet they
were hardly what she wanted. She could make dream-worlds of her own, but no
dream-world would satisfy her now. She wanted some explanation of this hard,
real life,&mdash;the unhappy-looking father, seated at the dull
breakfast-table; the childish, bewildered mother; the little sordid tasks that
filled the hours, or the more oppressive emptiness of weary, joyless leisure;
the need of some tender, demonstrative love; the cruel sense that Tom
didn&rsquo;t mind what she thought or felt, and that they were no longer
playfellows together; the privation of all pleasant things that had come to
<i>her</i> more than to others,&mdash;she wanted some key that would enable her
to understand, and in understanding, to endure, the heavy weight that had
fallen on her young heart. If she had been taught &ldquo;real learning and
wisdom, such as great men knew,&rdquo; she thought she should have held the
secrets of life; if she had only books, that she might learn for herself what
wise men knew! Saints and martyrs had never interested Maggie so much as sages
and poets. She knew little of saints and martyrs, and had gathered, as a
general result of her teaching, that they were a temporary provision against
the spread of Catholicism, and had all died at Smithfield.
</p>

<p>
In one of these meditations it occurred to her that she had forgotten
Tom&rsquo;s school-books, which had been sent home in his trunk. But she found
the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few old ones which had been well
thumbed,&mdash;the Latin Dictionary and Grammar, a Delectus, a torn Eutropius,
the well-worn Virgil, Aldrich&rsquo;s Logic, and the exasperating Euclid.
Still, Latin, Euclid, and Logic would surely be a considerable step in
masculine wisdom,&mdash;in that knowledge which made men contented, and even
glad to live. Not that the yearning for effectual wisdom was quite unmixed; a
certain mirage would now and then rise on the desert of the future, in which
she seemed to see herself honoured for her surprising attainments. And so the
poor child, with her soul&rsquo;s hunger and her illusions of self-flattery,
began to nibble at this thick-rinded fruit of the tree of knowledge, filling
her vacant hours with Latin, geometry, and the forms of the syllogism, and
feeling a gleam of triumph now and then that her understanding was quite equal
to these peculiarly masculine studies. For a week or two she went on resolutely
enough, though with an occasional sinking of heart, as if she had set out
toward the Promised Land alone, and found it a thirsty, trackless, uncertain
journey. In the severity of her early resolution, she would take Aldrich out
into the fields, and then look off her book toward the sky, where the lark was
twinkling, or to the reeds and bushes by the river, from which the waterfowl
rustled forth on its anxious, awkward flight,&mdash;with a startled sense that
the relation between Aldrich and this living world was extremely remote for
her. The discouragement deepened as the days went on, and the eager heart
gained faster and faster on the patient mind. Somehow, when she sat at the
window with her book, her eyes <i>would</i> fix themselves blankly on the
outdoor sunshine; then they would fill with tears, and sometimes, if her mother
was not in the room, the studies would all end in sobbing. She rebelled against
her lot, she fainted under its loneliness, and fits even of anger and hatred
toward her father and mother, who were so unlike what she would have them to
be; toward Tom, who checked her, and met her thought or feeling always by some
thwarting difference,&mdash;would flow out over her affections and conscience
like a lava stream, and frighten her with a sense that it was not difficult for
her to become a demon. Then her brain would be busy with wild romances of a
flight from home in search of something less sordid and dreary; she would go to
some great man&mdash;Walter Scott, perhaps&mdash;and tell him how wretched and
how clever she was, and he would surely do something for her. But, in the
middle of her vision, her father would perhaps enter the room for the evening,
and, surprised that she sat still without noticing him, would say
complainingly, &ldquo;Come, am I to fetch my slippers myself?&rdquo; The voice
pierced through Maggie like a sword; there was another sadness besides her own,
and she had been thinking of turning her back on it and forsaking it.
</p>

<p>
This afternoon, the sight of Bob&rsquo;s cheerful freckled face had given her
discontent a new direction. She thought it was part of the hardship of her life
that there was laid upon her the burthen of larger wants than others seemed to
feel,&mdash;that she had to endure this wide, hopeless yearning for that
something, whatever it was, that was greatest and best on this earth. She
wished she could have been like Bob, with his easily satisfied ignorance, or
like Tom, who had something to do on which he could fix his mind with a steady
purpose, and disregard everything else. Poor child! as she leaned her head
against the window-frame, with her hands clasped tighter and tighter, and her
foot beating the ground, she was as lonely in her trouble as if she had been
the only gril in the civilised world of that day who had come out of her
school-life with a soul untrained for inevitable struggles, with no other part
of her inherited share in the hard-won treasures of thought which generations
of painful toil have laid up for the race of men, than shreds and patches of
feeble literature and false history, with much futile information about Saxon
and other kings of doubtful example, but unhappily quite without that knowledge
of the irreversible laws within and without her, which, governing the habits,
becomes morality, and developing the feelings of submission and dependence,
becomes religion,&mdash;as lonely in her trouble as if every other girl besides
herself had been cherished and watched over by elder minds, not forgetful of
their own early time, when need was keen and impulse strong.
</p>

<p>
At last Maggie&rsquo;s eyes glanced down on the books that lay on the
window-shelf, and she half forsook her reverie to turn over listlessly the
leaves of the &ldquo;Portrait Gallery,&rdquo; but she soon pushed this aside to
examine the little row of books tied together with string. &ldquo;Beauties of
the Spectator,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Economy of Human
Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gregory&rsquo;s Letters,&rdquo;&mdash;she knew the sort of
matter that was inside all these; the &ldquo;Christian Year,&rdquo;&mdash;that
seemed to be a hymnbook, and she laid it down again; but <i>Thomas à
Kempis?</i>&mdash;the name had come across her in her reading, and she felt the
satisfaction, which every one knows, of getting some ideas to attach to a name
that strays solitary in the memory. She took up the little, old, clumsy book
with some curiosity; it had the corners turned down in many places, and some
hand, now forever quiet, had made at certain passages strong pen-and-ink marks,
long since browned by time. Maggie turned from leaf to leaf, and read where the
quiet hand pointed: &ldquo;Know that the love of thyself doth hurt thee more
than anything in the world.... If thou seekest this or that, and wouldst be
here or there to enjoy thy own will and pleasure, thou shalt never be quiet nor
free from care; for in everything somewhat will be wanting, and in every place
there will be some that will cross thee.... Both above and below, which way
soever thou dost turn thee, everywhere thou shalt find the Cross; and
everywhere of necessity thou must have patience, if thou wilt have inward
peace, and enjoy an everlasting crown.... If thou desirest to mount unto this
height, thou must set out courageously, and lay the axe to the root, that thou
mayest pluck up and destroy that hidden inordinate inclination to thyself, and
unto all private and earthly good. On this sin, that a man inordinately loveth
himself, almost all dependeth, whatsoever is thoroughly to be overcome; which
evil being once overcome and subdued, there will presently ensue great peace
and tranquillity.... It is but little thou sufferest in comparison of them that
have suffered so much, were so strongly tempted, so grievously afflicted, so
many ways tried and exercised. Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more
heavy sufferings of others, that thou mayest the easier bear thy little
adversities. And if they seem not little unto thee, beware lest thy impatience
be the cause thereof.... Blessed are those ears that receive the whispers of
the divine voice, and listen not to the whisperings of the world. Blessed are
those ears which hearken not unto the voice which soundeth outwardly, but unto
the Truth, which teacheth inwardly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A strange thrill of awe passed through Maggie while she read, as if she had
been wakened in the night by a strain of solemn music, telling of beings whose
souls had been astir while hers was in stupor. She went on from one brown mark
to another, where the quiet hand seemed to point, hardly conscious that she was
reading, seeming rather to listen while a low voice said;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why dost thou here gaze about, since this is not the place of thy rest?
In heaven ought to be thy dwelling, and all earthly things are to be looked on
as they forward thy journey thither. All things pass away, and thou together
with them. Beware thou cleavest not unto them, lest thou be entangled and
perish.... If a man should give all his substance, yet it is as nothing. And if
he should do great penances, yet are they but little. And if he should attain
to all knowledge, he is yet far off. And if he should be of great virtue, and
very fervent devotion, yet is there much wanting; to wit, one thing, which is
most necessary for him. What is that? That having left all, he leave himself,
and go wholly out of himself, and retain nothing of self-love.... I have often
said unto thee, and now again I say the same, Forsake thyself, resign thyself,
and thou shalt enjoy much inward peace.... Then shall all vain imaginations,
evil perturbations, and superfluous cares fly away; then shall immoderate fear
leave thee, and inordinate love shall die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie drew a long breath and pushed her heavy hair back, as if to see a sudden
vision more clearly. Here, then, was a secret of life that would enable her to
renounce all other secrets; here was a sublime height to be reached without the
help of outward things; here was insight, and strength, and conquest, to be won
by means entirely within her own soul, where a supreme Teacher was waiting to
be heard. It flashed through her like the suddenly apprehended solution of a
problem, that all the miseries of her young life had come from fixing her heart
on her own pleasure, as if that were the central necessity of the universe; and
for the first time she saw the possibility of shifting the position from which
she looked at the gratification of her own desires,&mdash;of taking her stand
out of herself, and looking at her own life as an insignificant part of a
divinely guided whole. She read on and on in the old book, devouring eagerly
the dialogues with the invisible Teacher, the pattern of sorrow, the source of
all strength; returning to it after she had been called away, and reading till
the sun went down behind the willows. With all the hurry of an imagination that
could never rest in the present, she sat in the deepening twilight forming
plans of self-humiliation and entire devotedness; and in the ardor of first
discovery, renunciation seemed to her the entrance into that satisfaction which
she had so long been craving in vain. She had not perceived&mdash;how could she
until she had lived longer?&mdash;the inmost truth of the old monk&rsquo;s
out-pourings, that renunciation remains sorrow, though a sorrow borne
willingly. Maggie was still panting for happiness, and was in ecstasy because
she had found the key to it. She knew nothing of doctrines and systems, of
mysticism or quietism; but this voice out of the far-off middle ages was the
direct communication of a human soul&rsquo;s belief and experience, and came to
Maggie as an unquestioned message.
</p>

<p>
I suppose that is the reason why the small old-fashioned book, for which you
need only pay sixpence at a book-stall, works miracles to this day, turning
bitter waters into sweetness; while expensive sermons and treatises, newly
issued, leave all things as they were before. It was written down by a hand
that waited for the heart&rsquo;s prompting; it is the chronicle of a solitary,
hidden anguish, struggle, trust, and triumph, not written on velvet cushions to
teach endurance to those who are treading with bleeding feet on the stones. And
so it remains to all time a lasting record of human needs and human
consolations; the voice of a brother who, ages ago, felt and suffered and
renounced,&mdash;in the cloister, perhaps, with serge gown and tonsured head,
with much chanting and long fasts, and with a fashion of speech different from
ours,&mdash;but under the same silent far-off heavens, and with the same
passionate desires, the same strivings, the same failures, the same weariness.
</p>

<p>
In writing the history of unfashionable families, one is apt to fall into a
tone of emphasis which is very far from being the tone of good society, where
principles and beliefs are not only of an extremely moderate kind, but are
always presupposed, no subjects being eligible but such as can be touched with
a light and graceful irony. But then good society has its claret and its velvet
carpets, its dinner-engagements six weeks deep, its opera and its faëry
ball-rooms; rides off its <i>ennui</i> on thoroughbred horses; lounges at the
club; has to keep clear of crinoline vortices; gets its science done by
Faraday, and its religion by the superior clergy who are to be met in the best
houses,&mdash;how should it have time or need for belief and emphasis? But good
society, floated on gossamer wings of light irony, is of very expensive
production; requiring nothing less than a wide and arduous national life
condensed in unfragrant deafening factories, cramping itself in mines, sweating
at furnaces, grinding, hammering, weaving under more or less oppression of
carbonic acid, or else, spread over sheepwalks, and scattered in lonely houses
and huts on the clayey or chalky corn-lands, where the rainy days look dreary.
This wide national life is based entirely on emphasis,&mdash;the emphasis of
want, which urges it into all the activities necessary for the maintenance of
good society and light irony; it spends its heavy years often in a chill,
uncarpeted fashion, amidst family discord unsoftened by long corridors. Under
such circumstances, there are many among its myriads of souls who have
absolutely needed an emphatic belief, life in this unpleasurable shape
demanding some solution even to unspeculative minds,&mdash;just as you inquire
into the stuffing of your couch when anything galls you there, whereas
eider-down and perfect French springs excite no question. Some have an emphatic
belief in alcohol, and seek their <i>ekstasis</i> or outside standing-ground in
gin; but the rest require something that good society calls
&ldquo;enthusiasm,&rdquo; something that will present motives in an entire
absence of high prizes; something that will give patience and feed human love
when the limbs ache with weariness, and human looks are hard upon us;
something, clearly, that lies outside personal desires, that includes
resignation for ourselves and active love for what is not ourselves. Now and
then that sort of enthusiasm finds a far-echoing voice that comes from an
experience springing out of the deepest need; and it was by being brought
within the long lingering vibrations of such a voice that Maggie, with her
girl&rsquo;s face and unnoted sorrows, found an effort and a hope that helped
her through years of loneliness, making out a faith for herself without the aid
of established authorities and appointed guides; for they were not at hand, and
her need was pressing. From what you know of her, you will not be surprised
that she threw some exaggeration and wilfulness, some pride and impetuosity,
even into her self-renunciation; her own life was still a drama for her, in
which she demanded of herself that her part should be played with intensity.
And so it came to pass that she often lost the spirit of humility by being
excessive in the outward act; she often strove after too high a flight, and
came down with her poor little half-fledged wings dabbled in the mud. For
example, she not only determined to work at plain sewing, that she might
contribute something toward the fund in the tin box, but she went, in the first
instance, in her zeal of self-mortification, to ask for it at a linen shop in
St Ogg&rsquo;s, instead of getting it in a more quiet and indirect way; and
could see nothing but what was entirely wrong and unkind, nay, persecuting, in
Tom&rsquo;s reproof of her for this unnecessary act. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
<i>my</i> sister to do such things,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>
take care that the debts are paid, without your lowering yourself in that
way.&rdquo; Surely there was some tenderness and bravery mingled with the
worldliness and self-assertion of that little speech; but Maggie held it as
dross, overlooking the grains of gold, and took Tom&rsquo;s rebuke as one of
her outward crosses. Tom was very hard to her, she used to think, in her long
night-watchings,&mdash;to her who had always loved him so; and then she strove
to be contented with that hardness, and to require nothing. That is the path we
all like when we set out on our abandonment of egoism,&mdash;the path of
martyrdom and endurance, where the palm-branches grow, rather than the steep
highway of tolerance, just allowance, and self-blame, where there are no leafy
honours to be gathered and worn.
</p>

<p>
The old books, Virgil, Euclid, and Aldrich&mdash;that wrinkled fruit of the
tree of knowledge&mdash;had been all laid by; for Maggie had turned her back on
the vain ambition to share the thoughts of the wise. In her first ardor she
flung away the books with a sort of triumph that she had risen above the need
of them; and if they had been her own, she would have burned them, believing
that she would never repent. She read so eagerly and constantly in her three
books, the Bible, Thomas à Kempis, and the &ldquo;Christian Year&rdquo; (no
longer rejected as a &ldquo;hymn-book&rdquo;), that they filled her mind with a
continual stream of rhythmic memories; and she was too ardently learning to see
all nature and life in the light of her new faith, to need any other material
for her mind to work on, as she sat with her well-plied needle, making shirts
and other complicated stitchings, falsely called &ldquo;plain,&rdquo;&mdash;by
no means plain to Maggie, since wristband and sleeve and the like had a
capability of being sewed in wrong side outward in moments of mental wandering.
</p>

<p>
Hanging diligently over her sewing, Maggie was a sight any one might have been
pleased to look at. That new inward life of hers, notwithstanding some volcanic
upheavings of imprisoned passions, yet shone out in her face with a tender soft
light that mingled itself as added loveliness with the gradually enriched
colour and outline of her blossoming youth. Her mother felt the change in her
with a sort of puzzled wonder that Maggie should be &ldquo;growing up so
good&rdquo;; it was amazing that this once &ldquo;contrairy&rdquo; child was
become so submissive, so backward to assert her own will. Maggie used to look
up from her work and find her mother&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon her; they were
watching and waiting for the large young glance, as if her elder frame got some
needful warmth from it. The mother was getting fond of her tall, brown
girl,&mdash;the only bit of furniture now on which she could bestow her anxiety
and pride; and Maggie, in spite of her own ascetic wish to have no personal
adornment, was obliged to give way to her mother about her hair, and submit to
have the abundant black locks plaited into a coronet on the summit of her head,
after the pitiable fashion of those antiquated times.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let your mother have that bit o&rsquo; pleasure, my dear,&rdquo; said
Mrs Tulliver; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d trouble enough with your hair once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So Maggie, glad of anything that would soothe her mother, and cheer their long
day together, consented to the vain decoration, and showed a queenly head above
her old frocks, steadily refusing, however, to look at herself in the glass.
Mrs Tulliver liked to call the father&rsquo;s attention to Maggie&rsquo;s hair
and other unexpected virtues, but he had a brusk reply to give.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew well enough what she&rsquo;d be, before now,&mdash;it&rsquo;s
nothing new to me. But it&rsquo;s a pity she isn&rsquo;t made o&rsquo; commoner
stuff; she&rsquo;ll be thrown away, I doubt,&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be nobody to
marry her as is fit for her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Maggie&rsquo;s graces of mind and body fed his gloom. He sat patiently
enough while she read him a chapter, or said something timidly when they were
alone together about trouble being turned into a blessing. He took it all as
part of his daughter&rsquo;s goodness, which made his misfortunes the sadder to
him because they damaged her chance in life. In a mind charged with an eager
purpose and an unsatisfied vindictiveness, there is no room for new feelings;
Mr Tulliver did not want spiritual consolation&mdash;he wanted to shake off
the degradation of debt, and to have his revenge.

<p>
The family sitting-room was a long room with a window at each end; one looking
toward the croft and along the Ripple to the banks of the Floss, the other into
the mill-yard. Maggie was sitting with her work against the latter window when
she saw Mr Wakem entering the yard, as usual, on his fine black horse; but not
alone, as usual. Some one was with him,&mdash;a figure in a cloak, on a
handsome pony. Maggie had hardly time to feel that it was Philip come back,
before they were in front of the window, and he was raising his hat to her;
while his father, catching the movement by a side-glance, looked sharply round
at them both.
</p>

<p>
Maggie hurried away from the window and carried her work upstairs; for Mr
Wakem sometimes came in and inspected the books, and Maggie felt that the
meeting with Philip would be robbed of all pleasure in the presence of the two
fathers. Some day, perhaps, she could see him when they could just shake hands,
and she could tell him that she remembered his goodness to Tom, and the things
he had said to her in the old days, though they could never be friends any
more. It was not at all agitating to Maggie to see Philip again; she retained
her childish gratitude and pity toward him, and remembered his cleverness; and
in the early weeks of her loneliness she had continually recalled the image of
him among the people who had been kind to her in life, often wishing she had
him for a brother and a teacher, as they had fancied it might have been, in
their talk together. But that sort of wishing had been banished along with
other dreams that savored of seeking her own will; and she thought, besides,
that Philip might be altered by his life abroad,&mdash;he might have become
worldly, and really not care about her saying anything to him now. And yet his
face was wonderfully little altered,&mdash;it was only a larger, more manly
copy of the pale, small-featured boy&rsquo;s face, with the gray eyes, and the
boyish waving brown hair; there was the old deformity to awaken the old pity;
and after all her meditations, Maggie felt that she really <i>should</i> like
to say a few words to him. He might still be melancholy, as he always used to
be, and like her to look at him kindly. She wondered if he remembered how he
used to like her eyes; with that thought Maggie glanced toward the square
looking-glass which was condemned to hang with its face toward the wall, and
she half started from her seat to reach it down; but she checked herself and
snatched up her work, trying to repress the rising wishes by forcing her memory
to recall snatches of hymns, until she saw Philip and his father returning
along the road, and she could go down again.
</p>

<p>
It was far on in June now, and Maggie was inclined to lengthen the daily walk
which was her one indulgence; but this day and the following she was so busy
with work which must be finished that she never went beyond the gate, and
satisfied her need of the open air by sitting out of doors. One of her frequent
walks, when she was not obliged to go to St Ogg&rsquo;s, was to a spot that
lay beyond what was called the &ldquo;Hill,&rdquo;&mdash;an insignificant rise
of ground crowned by trees, lying along the side of the road which ran by the
gates of Dorlcote Mill. Insignificant I call it, because in height it was
hardly more than a bank; but there may come moments when Nature makes a mere
bank a means toward a fateful result; and that is why I ask you to imagine this
high bank crowned with trees, making an uneven wall for some quarter of a mile
along the left side of Dorlcote Mill and the pleasant fields behind it, bounded
by the murmuring Ripple. Just where this line of bank sloped down again to the
level, a by-road turned off and led to the other side of the rise, where it was
broken into very capricious hollows and mounds by the working of an exhausted
stone-quarry, so long exhausted that both mounds and hollows were now clothed
with brambles and trees, and here and there by a stretch of grass which a few
sheep kept close-nibbled. In her childish days Maggie held this place, called
the Red Deeps, in very great awe, and needed all her confidence in Tom&rsquo;s
bravery to reconcile her to an excursion thither,&mdash;visions of robbers and
fierce animals haunting every hollow. But now it had the charm for her which
any broken ground, any mimic rock and ravine, have for the eyes that rest
habitually on the level; especially in summer, when she could sit on a grassy
hollow under the shadow of a branching ash, stooping aslant from the steep
above her, and listen to the hum of insects, like tiniest bells on the garment
of Silence, or see the sunlight piercing the distant boughs, as if to chase and
drive home the truant heavenly blue of the wild hyacinths. In this June time,
too, the dog-roses were in their glory, and that was an additional reason why
Maggie should direct her walk to the Red Deeps, rather than to any other spot,
on the first day she was free to wander at her will,&mdash;a pleasure she loved
so well, that sometimes, in her ardors of renunciation, she thought she ought
to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it.
</p>

<p>
You may see her now, as she walks down the favourite turning and enters the
Deeps by a narrow path through a group of Scotch firs, her tall figure and old
lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk shawl of some
wide-meshed net-like material; and now she is sure of being unseen she takes
off her bonnet and ties it over her arm. One would certainly suppose her to be
farther on in life than her seventeenth year&mdash;perhaps because of the slow
resigned sadness of the glance from which all search and unrest seem to have
departed; perhaps because her broad-chested figure has the mould of early
womanhood. Youth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary
hardships of her lot, and the nights in which she has lain on the hard floor
for a penance have left no obvious trace; the eyes are liquid, the brown cheek
is firm and round, the full lips are red. With her dark colouring and jet crown
surmounting her tall figure, she seems to have a sort of kinship with the grand
Scotch firs, at which she is looking up as if she loved them well. Yet one has
a sense of uneasiness in looking at her,&mdash;a sense of opposing elements, of
which a fierce collision is imminent; surely there is a hushed expression, such
as one often sees in older faces under borderless caps, out of keeping with the
resistant youth, which one expects to flash out in a sudden, passionate glance,
that will dissipate all the quietude, like a damp fire leaping out again when
all seemed safe.
</p>

<p>
But Maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment. She was clamly enjoying the
free air, while she looked up at the old fir-trees, and thought that those
broken ends of branches were the records of past storms, which had only made
the red stems soar higher. But while her eyes were still turned upward, she
became conscious of a moving shadow cast by the evening sun on the grassy path
before her, and looked down with a startled gesture to see Philip Wakem, who
first raised his hat, and then, blushing deeply, came forward to her and put
out his hand. Maggie, too, coloured with surprise, which soon gave way to
pleasure. She put out her hand and looked down at the deformed figure before
her with frank eyes, filled for the moment with nothing but the memory of her
child&rsquo;s feelings,&mdash;a memory that was always strong in her. She was
the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You startled me,&rdquo; she said, smiling faintly; &ldquo;I never meet
any one here. How came you to be walking here? Did you come to meet
<i>me?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was impossible not to perceive that Maggie felt herself a child again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Philip, still embarrassed; &ldquo;I wished to
see you very much. I watched a long while yesterday on the bank near your house
to see if you would come out, but you never came. Then I watched again to-day,
and when I saw the way you took, I kept you in sight and came down the bank,
behind there. I hope you will not be displeased with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie, with simple seriousness, walking on as if she
meant Philip to accompany her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you came, for I
wished very much to have an opportunity of speaking to you. I&rsquo;ve never
forgotten how good you were long ago to Tom, and me too; but I was not sure
that you would remember us so well. Tom and I have had a great deal of trouble
since then, and I think <i>that</i> makes one think more of what happened
before the trouble came.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you have thought of me so much as I have
thought of you,&rdquo; said Philip, timidly. &ldquo;Do you know, when I was
away, I made a picture of you as you looked that morning in the study when you
said you would not forget me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip drew a large miniature-case from his pocket, and opened it. Maggie saw
her old self leaning on a table, with her black locks hanging down behind her
ears, looking into space, with strange, dreamy eyes. It was a water-colour
sketch, of real merit as a portrait.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling, and flushed with pleasure,
&ldquo;what a queer little girl I was! I remember myself with my hair in that
way, in that pink frock. I really <i>was</i> like a gypsy. I dare say I am
now,&rdquo; she added, after a little pause; &ldquo;am I like what you expected
me to be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The words might have been those of a coquette, but the full, bright glance
Maggie turned on Philip was not that of a coquette. She really did hope he
liked her face as it was now, but it was simply the rising again of her innate
delight in admiration and love. Philip met her eyes and looked at her in
silence for a long moment, before he said quietly, &ldquo;No, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The light died out a little from Maggie&rsquo;s face, and there was a slight
trembling of the lip. Her eyelids fell lower, but she did not turn away her
head, and Philip continued to look at her. Then he said slowly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very much more beautiful than I thought you would be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; said Maggie, the pleasure returning in a deeper flush. She
turned her face away from him and took some steps, looking straight before her
in silence, as if she were adjusting her consciousness to this new idea. Girls
are so accustomed to think of dress as the main ground of vanity, that, in
abstaining from the looking-glass, Maggie had thought more of abandoning all
care for adornment than of renouncing the contemplation of her face. Comparing
herself with elegant, wealthy young ladies, it had not occurred to her that she
could produce any effect with her person. Philip seemed to like the silence
well. He walked by her side, watching her face, as if that sight left no room
for any other wish. They had passed from among the fir-trees, and had now come
to a green hollow almost surrounded by an amphitheatre of the pale pink
dog-roses. But as the light about them had brightened, Maggie&rsquo;s face had
lost its glow.
</p>

<p>
She stood still when they were in the hollows, and looking at Philip again, she
said in a serious, sad voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish we could have been friends,&mdash;I mean, if it would have been
good and right for us. But that is the trial I have to bear in everything; I
may not keep anything I used to love when I was little. The old books went; and
Tom is different, and my father. It is like death. I must part with everything
I cared for when I was a child. And I must part with you; we must never take
any notice of each other again. That was what I wanted to speak to you for. I
wanted to let you know that Tom and I can&rsquo;t do as we like about such
things, and that if I behave as if I had forgotten all about you, it is not out
of envy or pride&mdash;or&mdash;or any bad feeling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie spoke with more and more sorrowful gentleness as she went on, and her
eyes began to fill with tears. The deepening expression of pain on
Philip&rsquo;s face gave him a stronger resemblance to his boyish self, and
made the deformity appeal more strongly to her pity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know; I see all that you mean,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that had
become feebler from discouragement; &ldquo;I know what there is to keep us
apart on both sides. But it is not right, Maggie,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you be
angry with me, I am so used to call you Maggie in my thoughts,&mdash;it is not
right to sacrifice everything to other people&rsquo;s unreasonable feelings. I
would give up a great deal for <i>my</i> father; but I would not give up a
friendship or&mdash;or an attachment of any sort, in obedience to any wish of
his that I didn&rsquo;t recognise as right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Maggie, musingly. &ldquo;Often, when I
have been angry and discontented, it has seemed to me that I was not bound to
give up anything; and I have gone on thinking till it has seemed to me that I
could think away all my duty. But no good has ever come of that; it was an evil
state of mind. I&rsquo;m quite sure that whatever I might do, I should wish in
the end that I had gone without anything for myself, rather than have made my
father&rsquo;s life harder to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other
sometimes?&rdquo; said Philip. He was going to say something else, but checked
himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t like it. Don&rsquo;t ask me why, or
anything about it,&rdquo; said Maggie, in a distressed tone. &ldquo;My father
feels so strongly about some things. He is not at all happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more am I,&rdquo; said Philip, impetuously; &ldquo;I am not
happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Maggie, gently. &ldquo;At least&mdash;I ought not to
ask&mdash;but I&rsquo;m very, very sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip turned to walk on, as if he had not patience to stand still any longer,
and they went out of the hollow, winding amongst the trees and bushes in
silence. After that last word of Philip&rsquo;s, Maggie could not bear to
insist immediately on their parting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a great deal happier,&rdquo; she said at last, timidly,
&ldquo;since I have given up thinking about what is easy and pleasant, and
being discontented because I couldn&rsquo;t have my own will. Our life is
determined for us; and it makes the mind very free when we give up wishing, and
only think of bearing what is laid upon us, and doing what is given us to
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t give up wishing,&rdquo; said Philip, impatiently.
&ldquo;It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are
thoroughly alive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good,
and we <i>must</i> hunger after them. How can we ever be satisfied without them
until our feelings are deadened? I delight in fine pictures; I long to be able
to paint such. I strive and strive, and can&rsquo;t produce what I want. That
is pain to me, and always <i>will</i> be pain, until my faculties lose their
keenness, like aged eyes. Then there are many other things I long
for,&rdquo;&mdash;here Philip hesitated a little, and then
said,&mdash;&ldquo;things that other men have, and that will always be denied
me. My life will have nothing great or beautiful in it; I would rather not have
lived.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;I wish you didn&rsquo;t feel
so.&rdquo; But her heart began to beat with something of Philip&rsquo;s
discontent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, turning quickly round and fixing his gray
eyes entreatingly on her face, &ldquo;I should be contented to live, if you
would let me see you sometimes.&rdquo; Then, checked by a fear which her face
suggested, he looked away again and said more calmly, &ldquo;I have no friend
to whom I can tell everything, no one who cares enough about me; and if I could
only see you now and then, and you would let me talk to you a little, and show
me that you cared for me, and that we may always be friends in heart, and help
each other, then I might come to be glad of life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how can I see you, Philip?&rdquo; said Maggie, falteringly. (Could
she really do him good? It would be very hard to say &ldquo;good-by&rdquo; this
day, and not speak to him again. Here was a new interest to vary the days; it
was so much easier to renounce the interest before it came.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you would let me see you here sometimes,&mdash;walk with you
here,&mdash;I would be contented if it were only once or twice in a month.
<i>That</i> could injure no one&rsquo;s happiness, and it would sweeten my
life. Besides,&rdquo; Philip went on, with all the inventive astuteness of love
at one-and-twenty, &ldquo;if there is any enmity between those who belong to
us, we ought all the more to try and quench it by our friendship; I mean, that
by our influence on both sides we might bring about a healing of the wounds
that have been made in the past, if I could know everything about them. And I
don&rsquo;t believe there is any enmity in my own father&rsquo;s mind; I think
he has proved the contrary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie shook her head slowly, and was silent, under conflicting thoughts. It
seemed to her inclination, that to see Philip now and then, and keep up the
bond of friendship with him, was something not only innocent, but good; perhaps
she might really help him to find contentment as she had found it. The voice
that said this made sweet music to Maggie; but athwart it there came an urgent,
monotonous warning from another voice which she had been learning to
obey,&mdash;the warning that such interviews implied secrecy; implied doing
something she would dread to be discovered in, something that, if discovered,
must cause anger and pain; and that the admission of anything so near
doubleness would act as a spiritual blight. Yet the music would swell out
again, like chimes borne onward by a recurrent breeze, persuading her that the
wrong lay all in the faults and weaknesses of others, and that there was such a
thing as futile sacrifice for one to the injury of another. It was very cruel
for Philip that he should be shrunk from, because of an unjustifiable
vindictiveness toward his father,&mdash;poor Philip, whom some people would
shrink from only because he was deformed. The idea that he might become her
lover or that her meeting him could cause disapproval in that light, had not
occurred to her; and Philip saw the absence of this idea clearly enough, saw it
with a certain pang, although it made her consent to his request the less
unlikely. There was bitterness to him in the perception that Maggie was almost
as frank and unconstrained toward him as when she was a child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say either yes or no,&rdquo; she said at last, turning
round and walking toward the way she come; &ldquo;I must wait, lest I should
decide wrongly. I must seek for guidance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I come again, then, to-morrow, or the next day, or next week?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I had better write,&rdquo; said Maggie, faltering again.
&ldquo;I have to go to St Ogg&rsquo;s sometimes, and I can put the letter in
the post.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Philip eagerly; &ldquo;that would not be so well. My
father might see the letter&mdash;and&mdash;he has not any enmity, I believe,
but he views things differently from me; he thinks a great deal about wealth
and position. Pray let me come here once more. <i>Tell</i> me when it shall be;
or if you can&rsquo;t tell me, I will come as often as I can till I do see
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it must be so, then,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;for I
can&rsquo;t be quite certain of coming here any particular evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie felt a great relief in adjourning the decision. She was free now to
enjoy the minutes of companionship; she almost thought she might linger a
little; the next time they met she should have to pain Philip by telling him
her determination.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking,&rdquo; she said, looking smilingly at him,
after a few moments of silence, &ldquo;how strange it is that we should have
met and talked to each other, just as if it had been only yesterday when we
parted at Lorton. And yet we must both be very much altered in those five
years,&mdash;I think it is five years. How was it you seemed to have a sort of
feeling that I was the same Maggie? I was not quite so sure that you would be
the same; I know you are so clever, and you must have seen and learnt so much
to fill your mind; I was not quite sure you would care about me now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never had any doubt that you would be the same, whenever I might
see you,&rdquo; said Philip,&mdash;&ldquo;I mean, the same in everything that
made me like you better than any one else. I don&rsquo;t want to explain that;
I don&rsquo;t think any of the strongest effects our natures are susceptible of
can ever be explained. We can neither detect the process by which they are
arrived at, nor the mode in which they act on us. The greatest of painters only
once painted a mysteriously divine child; he couldn&rsquo;t have told how he
did it, and we can&rsquo;t tell why we feel it to be divine. I think there are
stores laid up in our human nature that our understandings can make no complete
inventory of. Certain strains of music affect me so strangely; I can never hear
them without their changing my whole attitude of mind for a time, and if the
effect would last, I might be capable of heroisms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! I know what you mean about music; <i>I</i> feel so,&rdquo; said
Maggie, clasping her hands with her old impetuosity. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo;
she added, in a saddened tone, &ldquo;I used to feel so when I had any music; I
never have any now except the organ at church.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you long for it, Maggie?&rdquo; said Philip, looking at her with
affectionate pity. &ldquo;Ah, you can have very little that is beautiful in
your life. Have you many books? You were so fond of them when you were a little
girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were come back to the hollow, round which the dog-roses grew, and they
both paused under the charm of the faëry evening light, reflected from the pale
pink clusters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I have given up books,&rdquo; said Maggie, quietly, &ldquo;except a
very, very few.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had already taken from his pocket a small volume, and was looking at the
back as he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, this is the second volume, I see, else you might have liked to take
it home with you. I put it in my pocket because I am studying a scene for a
picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie had looked at the back too, and saw the title; it revived an old
impression with overmastering force.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Pirate,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, taking the book from
Philip&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Oh, I began that once; I read to where Minna is
walking with Cleveland, and I could never get to read the rest. I went on with
it in my own head, and I made several endings; but they were all unhappy. I
could never make a happy ending out of that beginning. Poor Minna! I wonder
what is the real end. For a long while I couldn&rsquo;t get my mind away from
the Shetland Isles,&mdash;I used to feel the wind blowing on me from the rough
sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie spoke rapidly, with glistening eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take that volume home with you, Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, watching her
with delight. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it now. I shall make a picture of you
instead,&mdash;you, among the Scotch firs and the slanting shadows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie had not heard a word he had said; she was absorbed in a page at which
she had opened. But suddenly she closed the book, and gave it back to Philip,
shaking her head with a backward movement, as if to say &ldquo;avaunt&rdquo; to
floating visions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do keep it, Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, entreatingly; &ldquo;it will
give you pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Maggie, putting it aside with her hand and
walking on. &ldquo;It would make me in love with this world again, as I used to
be; it would make me long to see and know many things; it would make me long
for a full life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you will not always be shut up in your present lot; why should you
starve your mind in that way? It is narrow asceticism; I don&rsquo;t like to
see you persisting in it, Maggie. Poetry and art and knowledge are sacred and
pure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But not for me, not for me,&rdquo; said Maggie, walking more hurriedly;
&ldquo;because I should want too much. I must wait; this life will not last
long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry away from me without saying &lsquo;good-by,&rsquo;
Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, as they reached the group of Scotch firs, and she
continued still to walk along without speaking. &ldquo;I must not go any
farther, I think, must I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I forgot; good-by,&rdquo; said Maggie, pausing, and putting out
her hand to him. The action brought her feeling back in a strong current to
Philip; and after they had stood looking at each other in silence for a few
moments, with their hands clasped, she said, withdrawing her hand:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very grateful to you for thinking of me all those years. It is
very sweet to have people love us. What a wonderful, beautiful thing it seems
that God should have made your heart so that you could care about a queer
little girl whom you only knew for a few weeks! I remember saying to you that I
thought you cared for me more than Tom did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, almost fretfully, &ldquo;you would never
love me so well as you love your brother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Maggie, simply; &ldquo;but then, you know, the
first thing I ever remember in my life is standing with Tom by the side of the
Floss, while he held my hand; everything before that is dark to me. But I shall
never forget you, though we must keep apart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;If I kept that
little girl in my mind for five years, didn&rsquo;t I earn some part in her?
She ought not to take herself quite away from me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not if I were free,&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;but I am not, I must
submit.&rdquo; She hesitated a moment, and then added, &ldquo;And I wanted to
say to you, that you had better not take more notice of my brother than just
bowing to him. He once told me not to speak to you again, and he doesn&rsquo;t
change his mind&mdash;Oh dear, the sun is set. I am too long away.
Good-by.&rdquo; She gave him her hand once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall come here as often as I can till I see you again, Maggie. Have
some feeling for <i>me</i> as well as for others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, I have,&rdquo; said Maggie, hurrying away, and quickly
disappearing behind the last fir-tree; though Philip&rsquo;s gaze after her
remained immovable for minutes as if he saw her still.
</p>

<p>
Maggie went home, with an inward conflict already begun; Philip went home to do
nothing but remember and hope. You can hardly help blaming him severely. He was
four or five years older than Maggie, and had a full consciousness of his
feeling toward her to aid him in foreseeing the character his contemplated
interviews with her would bear in the opinion of a third person. But you must
not suppose that he was capable of a gross selfishness, or that he could have
been satisfied without persuading himself that he was seeking to infuse some
happiness into Maggie&rsquo;s life,&mdash;seeking this even more than any
direct ends for himself. He could give her sympathy; he could give her help.
There was not the slightest promise of love toward him in her manner; it was
nothing more than the sweet girlish tenderness she had shown him when she was
twelve. Perhaps she would never love him; perhaps no woman ever <i>could</i>
love him. Well, then, he would endure that; he should at least have the
happiness of seeing her, of feeling some nearness to her. And he clutched
passionately the possibility that she <i>might</i> love him; perhaps the
feeling would grow, if she could come to associate him with that watchful
tenderness which her nature would be so keenly alive to. If any woman could
love him, surely Maggie was that woman; there was such wealth of love in her,
and there was no one to claim it all. Then, the pity of it, that a mind like
hers should be withering in its very youth, like a young forest-tree, for want
of the light and space it was formed to flourish in! Could he not hinder that,
by persuading her out of her system of privation? He would be her guardian
angel; he would do anything, bear anything, for her sake&mdash;except not
seeing her.

<h3><a name="chap34"></a>Chapter II.<br/>
Aunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob&rsquo;s Thumb</h3>

<p>
While Maggie&rsquo;s life-struggles had lain almost entirely within her own
soul, one shadowy army fighting another, and the slain shadows forever rising
again, Tom was engaged in a dustier, noisier warfare, grappling with more
substantial obstacles, and gaining more definite conquests. So it has been
since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of horses; inside the gates, the
women with streaming hair and uplifted hands offering prayers, watching the
world&rsquo;s combat from afar, filling their long, empty days with memories
and fears; outside, the men, in fierce struggle with things divine and human,
quenching memory in the stronger light of purpose, losing the sense of dread
and even of wounds in the hurrying ardor of action.
</p>

<p>
From what you have seen of Tom, I think he is not a youth of whom you would
prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished; the wagers are likely to
be on his side, notwithstanding his small success in the classics. For Tom had
never desired success in this field of enterprise; and for getting a fine
flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring out on a mind a
good amount of subjects in which it feels no interest. But now Tom&rsquo;s
strong will bound together his integrity, his pride, his family regrets, and
his personal ambition, and made them one force, concentrating his efforts and
surmounting discouragements. His uncle Deane, who watched him closely, soon
began to conceive hopes of him, and to be rather proud that he had brought into
the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be made of such good
commercial stuff. The real kindness of placing him in the warehouse first was
soon evident to Tom, in the hints his uncle began to throw out, that after a
time he might perhaps be trusted to travel at certain seasons, and buy in for
the firm various vulgar commodities with which I need not shock refined ears in
this place; and it was doubtless with a view to this result that Mr Deane,
when he expected to take his wine alone, would tell Tom to step in and sit with
him an hour, and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising
concerning articles of export and import, with an occasional excursus of more
indirect utility on the relative advantages to the merchants of St Ogg&rsquo;s
of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottoms,&mdash;a subject on
which Mr Deane, as a ship-owner, naturally threw off a few sparks when he got
warmed with talk and wine.
</p>

<p>
Already, in the second year, Tom&rsquo;s salary was raised; but all, except the
price of his dinner and clothes, went home into the tin box; and he shunned
comradeship, lest it should lead him into expenses in spite of himself. Not
that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the Industrious Apprentice; he had a
very strong appetite for pleasure,&mdash;would have liked to be a Tamer of
horses and to make a distinguished figure in all neighbouring eyes, dispensing
treats and benefits to others with well-judged liberality, and being pronounced
one of the finest young fellows of those parts; nay, he determined to achieve
these things sooner or later; but his practical shrewdness told him that the
means to such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence and
self-denial; there were certain milestones to be passed, and one of the first
was the payment of his father&rsquo;s debts. Having made up his mind on that
point, he strode along without swerving, contracting some rather saturnine
sternness, as a young man is likely to do who has a premature call upon him for
self-reliance. Tom felt intensely that common cause with his father which
springs from family pride, and was bent on being irreproachable as a son; but
his growing experience caused him to pass much silent criticism on the rashness
and imprudence of his father&rsquo;s past conduct; their dispositions were not
in sympathy, and Tom&rsquo;s face showed little radiance during his few home
hours. Maggie had an awe of him, against which she struggled as something
unfair to her consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of
no use to struggle. A character at unity with itself&mdash;that performs what
it intends, subdues every counteracting impulse, and has no visions beyond the
distinctly possible&mdash;is strong by its very negations.
</p>

<p>
You may imagine that Tom&rsquo;s more and more obvious unlikeness to his father
was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles; and Mr
Deane&rsquo;s favourable reports and predictions to Mr Glegg concerning
Tom&rsquo;s qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them with
various acceptance. He was likely, it appeared, to do the family credit without
causing it any expense and trouble. Mrs Pullet had always thought it strange if
Tom&rsquo;s excellent complexion, so entirely that of the Dodsons, did not
argue a certainty that he would turn out well; his juvenile errors of running
down the peacock, and general disrespect to his aunts, only indicating a tinge
of Tulliver blood which he had doubtless outgrown. Mr Glegg, who had contracted
a cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behaviour when
the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution to further
his prospects actively,&mdash;some time, when an opportunity offered of doing
so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs Glegg observed that she
was not given to speak without book, as some people were; that those who said
least were most likely to find their words made good; and that when the right
moment came, it would be seen who could do something better than talk. Uncle
Pullet, after silent meditation for a period of several lozenges, came
distinctly to the conclusion, that when a young man was likely to do well, it
was better not to meddle with him.
</p>

<p>
Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but himself,
though, with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of favourable
opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him sometimes in a
friendly way during business hours, and glad to be invited to dine at his
house, though he usually preferred declining on the ground that he was not sure
of being punctual. But about a year ago, something had occurred which induced
Tom to test his uncle Glegg&rsquo;s friendly disposition.
</p>

<p>
Bob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing Tom and
Maggie, awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from St Ogg&rsquo;s
one evening, that they might have a little private talk. He took the liberty of
asking if Mr Tom had ever thought of making money by trading a bit on his own
account. Trading, how? Tom wished to know. Why, by sending out a bit of a cargo
to foreign ports; because Bob had a particular friend who had offered to do a
little business for him in that way in Laceham goods, and would be glad to
serve Mr Tom on the same footing. Tom was interested at once, and begged for
full explanation, wondering he had not thought of this plan before.
</p>

<p>
He was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might change the
slow process of addition into multiplication, that he at once determined to
mention the matter to his father, and get his consent to appropriate some of
the savings in the tin box to the purchase of a small cargo. He would rather
not have consulted his father, but he had just paid his last quarter&rsquo;s
money into the tin box, and there was no other resource. All the savings were
there; for Mr Tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest
he should lose it. Since he had speculated in the purchase of some corn, and
had lost by it, he could not be easy without keeping the money under his eye.
</p>

<p>
Tom approached the subject carefully, as he was seated on the hearth with his
father that evening, and Mr Tulliver listened, leaning forward in his
arm-chair and looking up in Tom&rsquo;s face with a sceptical glance. His first
impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he was in some awe of Tom&rsquo;s
wishes, and since he had the sense of being an &ldquo;unlucky&rdquo; father, he
had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to be master. He took
the key of the bureau from his pocket, got out the key of the large chest, and
fetched down the tin box,&mdash;slowly, as if he were trying to defer the
moment of a painful parting. Then he seated himself against the table, and
opened the box with that little padlock-key which he fingered in his waistcoat
pocket in all vacant moments. There they were, the dingy bank-notes and the
bright sovereigns, and he counted them out on the table&mdash;only a hundred
and sixteen pounds in two years, after all the pinching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How much do you want, then?&rdquo; he said, speaking as if the words
burnt his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose I begin with the thirty-six pounds, father?&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his hand over it,
said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as much as I can save out o&rsquo; my pay in a year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, father; it is such slow work, saving out of the little money we
get. And in this way we might double our savings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, my lad,&rdquo; said the father, keeping his hand on the money,
&ldquo;but you might lose it,&mdash;you might lose a year o&rsquo; my
life,&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t got many.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom was silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you know I wouldn&rsquo;t pay a dividend with the first hundred,
because I wanted to see it all in a lump,&mdash;and when I see it, I&rsquo;m
sure on&rsquo;t. If you trust to luck, it&rsquo;s sure to be against me.
It&rsquo;s Old Harry&rsquo;s got the luck in his hands; and if I lose one year,
I shall never pick it up again; death &rsquo;ull o&rsquo;ertake me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes
before he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it up, father, since you object to it so
strongly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he determined to ask his uncle
Glegg to venture twenty pounds, on condition of receiving five per cent. of the
profits. That was really a very small thing to ask. So when Bob called the next
day at the wharf to know the decision, Tom proposed that they should go
together to his uncle Glegg&rsquo;s to open the business; for his diffident
pride clung to him, and made him feel that Bobs&rsquo; tongue would relieve him
from some embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August day,
was naturally counting his wall-fruit to assure himself that the sum total had
not varied since yesterday. To him entered Tom, in what appeared to Mr Glegg
very questionable companionship,&mdash;that of a man with a pack on his
back,&mdash;for Bob was equipped for a new journey,&mdash;and of a huge
brindled bull-terrier, who walked with a slow, swaying movement from side to
side, and glanced from under his eye-lids with a surly indifference which might
after all be a cover to the most offensive designs.
</p>

<p>
Mr Glegg&rsquo;s spectacles, which had been assisting him in counting the
fruit, made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heigh! heigh! keep that dog back, will you?&rdquo; he shouted, snatching
up a stake and holding it before him as a shield when the visitors were within
three yards of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get out wi&rsquo; you, Mumps,&rdquo; said Bob, with a kick.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as quiet as a lamb, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;an observation which
Mumps corroborated by a low growl as he retreated behind his master&rsquo;s
legs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what ever does this mean, Tom?&rdquo; said Mr Glegg. &ldquo;Have
you brought information about the scoundrels as cut my trees?&rdquo; If Bob
came in the character of &ldquo;information,&rdquo; Mr Glegg saw reasons for
tolerating some irregularity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;I came to speak to you about a little
matter of business of my own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay&mdash;well; but what has this dog got to do with it?&rdquo; said the
old gentleman, getting mild again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dog, sir,&rdquo; said the ready Bob. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s me as put Mr Tom up to the bit o&rsquo; business; for Mr
Tom&rsquo;s been a friend o&rsquo; mine iver since I was a little chap; fust
thing iver I did was frightenin&rsquo; the birds for th&rsquo; old master.
An&rsquo; if a bit o&rsquo; luck turns up, I&rsquo;m allays thinkin&rsquo; if I
can let Mr Tom have a pull at it. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a downright
roarin&rsquo; shame, as when he&rsquo;s got the chance o&rsquo; making a bit
o&rsquo; money wi&rsquo; sending goods out,&mdash;ten or twelve per zent clear,
when freight an&rsquo; commission&rsquo;s paid,&mdash;as he shouldn&rsquo;t lay
hold o&rsquo; the chance for want o&rsquo; money. An&rsquo; when there&rsquo;s
the Laceham goods,&mdash;lors! they&rsquo;re made o&rsquo; purpose for folks as
want to send out a little carguy; light, an&rsquo; take up no room,&mdash;you
may pack twenty pound so as you can&rsquo;t see the passill; an&rsquo;
they&rsquo;re manifacturs as please fools, so I reckon they aren&rsquo;t like
to want a market. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d go to Laceham an&rsquo; buy in the goods
for Mr Tom along wi&rsquo; my own. An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s the shupercargo
o&rsquo; the bit of a vessel as is goin&rsquo; to take &rsquo;em out. I know
him partic&rsquo;lar; he&rsquo;s a solid man, an&rsquo; got a family i&rsquo;
the town here. Salt, his name is,&mdash;an&rsquo; a briny chap he is
too,&mdash;an&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t believe me, I can take you to
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Uncle Glegg stood open-mouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed
loquacity, with which his understanding could hardly keep pace. He looked at
Bob, first over his spectacles, then through them, then over them again; while
Tom, doubtful of his uncle&rsquo;s impression, began to wish he had not brought
this singular Aaron, or mouthpiece. Bob&rsquo;s talk appeared less seemly, now
some one besides himself was listening to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to be a knowing fellow,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, sir, you say true,&rdquo; returned Bob, nodding his head aside;
&ldquo;I think my head&rsquo;s all alive inside like an old cheese, for
I&rsquo;m so full o&rsquo; plans, one knocks another over. If I hadn&rsquo;t
Mumps to talk to, I should get top-heavy an&rsquo; tumble in a fit. I suppose
it&rsquo;s because I niver went to school much. That&rsquo;s what I jaw my old
mother for. I says, &lsquo;You should ha&rsquo; sent me to school a bit
more,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;an&rsquo; then I could ha&rsquo; read i&rsquo; the
books like fun, an&rsquo; kep&rsquo; my head cool an&rsquo; empty.&rsquo; Lors,
she&rsquo;s fine an&rsquo; comfor&rsquo;ble now, my old mother is; she ates her
baked meat an&rsquo; taters as often as she likes. For I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo;
so full o&rsquo; money, I must hev a wife to spend it for me. But it&rsquo;s
botherin,&rsquo; a wife is,&mdash;and Mumps mightn&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Uncle Glegg, who regarded himself as a jocose man since he had retired from
business, was beginning to find Bob amusing, but he had still a disapproving
observation to make, which kept his face serious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;re at a loss for
ways o&rsquo; spending your money, else you wouldn&rsquo;t keep that big dog,
to eat as much as two Christians. It&rsquo;s shameful&mdash;shameful!&rdquo;
But he spoke more in sorrow than in anger, and quickly added:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, come now, let&rsquo;s hear more about this business, Tom. I suppose
you want a little sum to make a venture with. But where&rsquo;s all your own
money? You don&rsquo;t spend it all&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Tom, colouring; &ldquo;but my father is unwilling
to risk it, and I don&rsquo;t like to press him. If I could get twenty or
thirty pounds to begin with, I could pay five per cent for it, and then I could
gradually make a little capital of my own, and do without a loan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay&mdash;ay,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, in an approving tone;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s not a bad notion, and I won&rsquo;t say as I wouldn&rsquo;t
be your man. But it &rsquo;ull be as well for me to see this Salt, as you talk
on. And then&mdash;here&rsquo;s this friend o&rsquo; yours offers to buy the
goods for you. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve got somebody to stand surety for you if the
money&rsquo;s put into your hands?&rdquo; added the cautious old gentleman,
looking over his spectacles at Bob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessary, uncle,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;At least, I mean it would not be necessary for me, because I know Bob
well; but perhaps it would be right for you to have some security.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You get your percentage out o&rsquo; the purchase, I suppose?&rdquo;
said Mr Glegg, looking at Bob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Bob, rather indignantly; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
offer to get a apple for Mr Tom, o&rsquo; purpose to hev a bite out of it
myself. When I play folks tricks, there&rsquo;ll be more fun in &rsquo;em nor
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but it&rsquo;s nothing but right you should have a small
percentage,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no opinion o&rsquo;
transactions where folks do things for nothing. It allays looks bad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Bob, whose keenness saw at once what was
implied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I get by&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
money in my pocket in the end,&mdash;I make myself look big, wi&rsquo;
makin&rsquo; a bigger purchase. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking on. Lors!
I&rsquo;m a &rsquo;cute chap,&mdash;I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg, Mr Glegg!&rdquo; said a severe voice from the open parlour
window, &ldquo;pray are you coming in to tea, or are you going to stand talking
with packmen till you get murdered in the open daylight?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Murdered?&rdquo; said Mr Glegg; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the woman talking
of? Here&rsquo;s your nephey Tom come about a bit o&rsquo; business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Murdered,&mdash;yes,&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t many &rsquo;sizes ago since a
packman murdered a young woman in a lone place, and stole her thimble, and
threw her body into a ditch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, soothingly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
thinking o&rsquo; the man wi&rsquo; no legs, as drove a dog-cart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the same thing, Mr Glegg, only you&rsquo;re fond
o&rsquo; contradicting what I say; and if my nephey&rsquo;s come about
business, it &rsquo;ud be more fitting if you&rsquo;d bring him into the house,
and let his aunt know about it, instead o&rsquo; whispering in corners, in that
plotting, underminding way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll come in
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; said the lady to Bob, in a loud
voice, adapted to the moral, not the physical, distance between them. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want anything. I don&rsquo;t deal wi&rsquo; packmen. Mind you shut
the gate after you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop a bit; not so fast,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
done with this young man yet. Come in, Tom; come in,&rdquo; he added, stepping
in at the French window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said Mrs G., in a fatal tone, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re
going to let that man and his dog in on my carpet, before my very face, be so
good as to let me know. A wife&rsquo;s got a right to ask that, I hope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be uneasy, mum,&rdquo; said Bob, touching his cap. He
saw at once that Mrs Glegg was a bit of game worth running down, and longed to
be at the sport; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll stay out upo&rsquo; the gravel
here,&mdash;Mumps and me will. Mumps knows his company,&mdash;he does. I might
hish at him by th&rsquo; hour together, before he&rsquo;d fly at a real
gentlewoman like you. It&rsquo;s wonderful how he knows which is the
good-looking ladies; and&rsquo;s partic&rsquo;lar fond of &rsquo;em when
they&rsquo;ve good shapes. Lors!&rdquo; added Bob, laying down his pack on the
gravel, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a thousand pities such a lady as you shouldn&rsquo;t
deal with a packman, i&rsquo; stead o&rsquo; goin&rsquo; into these newfangled
shops, where there&rsquo;s half-a-dozen fine gents wi&rsquo; their chins
propped up wi&rsquo; a stiff stock, a-looking like bottles wi&rsquo; ornamental
stoppers, an&rsquo; all got to get their dinner out of a bit o&rsquo; calico;
it stan&rsquo;s to reason you must pay three times the price you pay a packman,
as is the nat&rsquo;ral way o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; goods,&mdash;an&rsquo; pays
no rent, an&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t forced to throttle himself till the lies are
squeezed out on him, whether he will or no. But lors! mum, you know what it is
better nor I do,&mdash;<i>you</i> can see through them shopmen, I&rsquo;ll be
bound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I reckon I can, and through the packmen too,&rdquo; observed Mrs
Glegg, intending to imply that Bob&rsquo;s flattery had produced no effect on
<i>her;</i> while her husband, standing behind her with his hands in his
pockets and legs apart, winked and smiled with conjugal delight at the
probability of his wife&rsquo;s being circumvented.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, to be sure, mum,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Why, you must ha&rsquo;
dealt wi&rsquo; no end o&rsquo; packmen when you war a young lass&mdash;before
the master here had the luck to set eyes on you. I know where you lived, I
do,&mdash;seen th&rsquo; house many a time,&mdash;close upon Squire
Darleigh&rsquo;s,&mdash;a stone house wi&rsquo; steps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, that it had,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, pouring out the tea. &ldquo;You
know something o&rsquo; my family, then? Are you akin to that packman with a
squint in his eye, as used to bring th&rsquo; Irish linen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look you there now!&rdquo; said Bob, evasively. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
know as you&rsquo;d remember the best bargains you&rsquo;ve made in your life
was made wi&rsquo; packmen? Why, you see even a squintin&rsquo; packman&rsquo;s
better nor a shopman as can see straight. Lors! if I&rsquo;d had the luck to
call at the stone house wi&rsquo; my pack, as lies here,&rdquo;&mdash;stooping
and thumping the bundle emphatically with his fist,&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo;
th&rsquo; handsome young lasses all stannin&rsquo; out on the stone steps, it
ud&rsquo; ha&rsquo; been summat like openin&rsquo; a pack, that would.
It&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y the poor houses now as a packman calls on, if it
isn&rsquo;t for the sake o&rsquo; the sarvant-maids. They&rsquo;re paltry
times, these are. Why, mum, look at the printed cottons now, an&rsquo; what
they was when you wore &rsquo;em,&mdash;why, you wouldn&rsquo;t put such a
thing on now, I can see. It must be first-rate quality, the manifactur as
you&rsquo;d buy,&mdash;summat as &rsquo;ud wear as well as your own
faitures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, better quality nor any you&rsquo;re like to carry; you&rsquo;ve got
nothing first-rate but brazenness, I&rsquo;ll be bound,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg,
with a triumphant sense of her insurmountable sagacity. &ldquo;Mr Glegg, are
you going ever to sit down to your tea? Tom, there&rsquo;s a cup for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You speak true there, mum,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;My pack isn&rsquo;t
for ladies like you. The time&rsquo;s gone by for that. Bargains picked up dirt
cheap! A bit o&rsquo; damage here an&rsquo; there, as can be cut out, or else
niver seen i&rsquo; the wearin&rsquo;, but not fit to offer to rich folks as
can pay for the look o&rsquo; things as nobody sees. I&rsquo;m not the man as
&rsquo;ud offer t&rsquo; open my pack to <i>you</i>, mum; no, no; I&rsquo;m a
imperent chap, as you say,&mdash;these times makes folks imperent,&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m not up to the mark o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what goods do you carry in your pack?&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg.
&ldquo;Fine-coloured things, I suppose,&mdash;shawls an&rsquo; that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All sorts, mum, all sorts,&rdquo; said Bob,&mdash;thumping his bundle;
&ldquo;but let us say no more about that, if <i>you</i> please. I&rsquo;m here
upo&rsquo; Mr Tom&rsquo;s business, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not the man to take up
the time wi&rsquo; my own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray, what <i>is</i> this business as is to be kept from me?&rdquo;
said Mrs Glegg, who, solicited by a double curiosity, was obliged to let the
one-half wait.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little plan o&rsquo; nephey Tom&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; said good-natured
Mr Glegg; &ldquo;and not altogether a bad &rsquo;un, I think. A little plan
for making money; that&rsquo;s the right sort o&rsquo; plan for young folks as
have got their fortin to make, eh, Jane?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I hope it isn&rsquo;t a plan where he expects iverything to be done
for him by his friends; that&rsquo;s what the young folks think of mostly
nowadays. And pray, what has this packman got to do wi&rsquo; what goes on in
our family? Can&rsquo;t you speak for yourself, Tom, and let your aunt know
things, as a nephey should?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is Bob Jakin, aunt,&rdquo; said Tom, bridling the irritation that
aunt Glegg&rsquo;s voice always produced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known him ever
since we were little boys. He&rsquo;s a very good fellow, and always ready to
do me a kindness. And he has had some experience in sending goods out,&mdash;a
small part of a cargo as a private speculation; and he thinks if I could begin
to do a little in the same way, I might make some money. A large interest is
got in that way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Large int&rsquo;rest?&rdquo; said aunt Glegg, with eagerness; &ldquo;and
what do you call large int&rsquo;rest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ten or twelve per cent, Bob says, after expenses are paid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why wasn&rsquo;t I let to know o&rsquo; such things before, Mr
Glegg?&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, turning to her husband, with a deep grating tone
of reproach. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you allays told me as there was no getting
more nor five per cent?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, nonsense, my good woman,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t go into trade, could you? You can&rsquo;t get more than five per
cent with security.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I can turn a bit o&rsquo; money for you, an&rsquo; welcome,
mum,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d like to risk it,&mdash;not as
there&rsquo;s any risk to speak on. But if you&rsquo;d a mind to lend a bit
o&rsquo; money to Mr Tom, he&rsquo;d pay you six or seven per zent, an&rsquo;
get a trifle for himself as well; an&rsquo; a good-natur&rsquo;d lady like you
&rsquo;ud like the feel o&rsquo; the money better if your nephey took part on
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you say, Mrs G.?&rdquo; said Mr Glegg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
notion, when I&rsquo;ve made a bit more inquiry, as I shall perhaps start Tom
here with a bit of a nest-egg,&mdash;he&rsquo;ll pay me int&rsquo;rest, you
know,&mdash;an&rsquo; if you&rsquo;ve got some little sums lyin&rsquo; idle
twisted up in a stockin&rsquo; toe, or that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg, it&rsquo;s beyond iverything! You&rsquo;ll go and give
information to the tramps next, as they may come and rob me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, as I was sayin&rsquo;, if you like to join me wi&rsquo;
twenty pounds, you can&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make it fifty. That&rsquo;ll be a
pretty good nest-egg, eh, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not counting on me, Mr Glegg, I hope,&rdquo; said his
wife. &ldquo;You could do fine things wi&rsquo; my money, I don&rsquo;t
doubt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, rather snappishly, &ldquo;then
we&rsquo;ll do without you. I shall go with you to see this Salt,&rdquo; he
added, turning to Bob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now, I suppose, you&rsquo;ll go all the other way, Mr Glegg,&rdquo;
said Mrs G., &ldquo;and want to shut me out o&rsquo; my own nephey&rsquo;s
business. I never said I wouldn&rsquo;t put money into it,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
say as it shall be twenty pounds, though you&rsquo;re so ready to say it for
me,&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll see some day as his aunt&rsquo;s in the right not to
risk the money she&rsquo;s saved for him till it&rsquo;s proved as it
won&rsquo;t be lost.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s a pleasant sort o&rsquo;risk, that is,&rdquo; said Mr
Glegg, indiscreetly winking at Tom, who couldn&rsquo;t avoid smiling. But Bob
stemmed the injured lady&rsquo;s outburst.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, mum,&rdquo; he said admiringly, &ldquo;you know what&rsquo;s
what&mdash;you do. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s nothing but fair. <i>You</i> see how
the first bit of a job answers, an&rsquo; then you&rsquo;ll come down handsome.
Lors, it&rsquo;s a fine thing to hev good kin. I got my bit of a nest-egg, as
the master calls it, all by my own sharpness,&mdash;ten suvreigns it
was,&mdash;wi&rsquo; dousing the fire at Torry&rsquo;s mill, an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s growed an&rsquo; growed by a bit an&rsquo; a bit, till I&rsquo;n got
a matter o&rsquo; thirty pound to lay out, besides makin&rsquo; my mother
comfor&rsquo;ble. I should get more, on&rsquo;y I&rsquo;m such a soft wi&rsquo;
the women,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em hev such good
bargains. There&rsquo;s this bundle, now,&rdquo; thumping it lustily,
&ldquo;any other chap &rsquo;ud make a pretty penny out on it. But
me!&mdash;lors, I shall sell &rsquo;em for pretty near what I paid for
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you got a bit of good net, now?&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, in a
patronizing tone, moving from the tea-table, and folding her napkin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, mum, not what you&rsquo;d think it worth your while to look at.
I&rsquo;d scorn to show it you. It &rsquo;ud be an insult to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But let me see,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, still patronizing. &ldquo;If
they&rsquo;re damaged goods, they&rsquo;re like enough to be a bit the better
quality.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, mum, I know my place,&rdquo; said Bob, lifting up his pack and
shouldering it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going t&rsquo; expose the lowness o&rsquo;
my trade to a lady like you. Packs is come down i&rsquo; the world; it
&rsquo;ud cut you to th&rsquo; heart to see the difference. I&rsquo;m at your
sarvice, sir, when you&rsquo;ve a mind to go and see Salt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, really unwilling to cut short
the dialogue. &ldquo;Are you wanted at the wharf, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; I left Stowe in my place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, put down your pack, and let me see,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg,
drawing a chair to the window and seating herself with much dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask it, mum,&rdquo; said Bob, entreatingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make no more words,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, severely, &ldquo;but do as I
tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh mum, I&rsquo;m loth, that I am,&rdquo; said Bob, slowly depositing
his pack on the step, and beginning to untie it with unwilling fingers.
&ldquo;But what you order shall be done&rdquo; (much fumbling in pauses between
the sentences). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as you&rsquo;ll buy a single thing on
me,&mdash;I&rsquo;d be sorry for you to do it,&mdash;for think o&rsquo; them
poor women up i&rsquo; the villages there, as niver stir a hundred yards from
home,&mdash;it &rsquo;ud be a pity for anybody to buy up their bargains. Lors,
it&rsquo;s as good as a junketing to &rsquo;em when they see me wi&rsquo; my
pack, an&rsquo; I shall niver pick up such bargains for &rsquo;em again. Least
ways, I&rsquo;ve no time now, for I&rsquo;m off to Laceham. See here
now,&rdquo; Bob went on, becoming rapid again, and holding up a scarlet woollen
Kerchief with an embroidered wreath in the corner; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a thing
to make a lass&rsquo;s mouth water, an&rsquo; on&rsquo;y two
shillin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; why? Why, &rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s a bit of a
moth-hole &rsquo;i this plain end. Lors, I think the moths an&rsquo; the mildew
was sent by Providence o&rsquo; purpose to cheapen the goods a bit for the
good-lookin&rsquo; women as han&rsquo;t got much money. If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for the moths, now, every hankicher on &rsquo;em &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; gone to
the rich, handsome ladies, like you, mum, at five shillin&rsquo;
apiece,&mdash;not a farthin&rsquo; less; but what does the moth do? Why, it
nibbles off three shillin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the price i&rsquo; no time; an&rsquo;
then a packman like me can carry &rsquo;t to the poor lasses as live under the
dark thack, to make a bit of a blaze for &rsquo;em. Lors, it&rsquo;s as good as
a fire, to look at such a hankicher!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob held it at a distance for admiration, but Mrs Glegg said sharply:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but nobody wants a fire this time o&rsquo; year. Put these coloured
things by; let me look at your nets, if you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, mum, I told you how it &rsquo;ud be,&rdquo; said Bob, flinging aside
the coloured things with an air of desperation. &ldquo;I knowed it ud&rsquo;
turn again&rsquo; you to look at such paltry articles as I carry. Here&rsquo;s
a piece o&rsquo; figured muslin now, what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; you
lookin&rsquo; at it? You might as well look at poor folks&rsquo;s victual, mum;
it &rsquo;ud on&rsquo;y take away your appetite. There&rsquo;s a yard i&rsquo;
the middle on&rsquo;t as the pattern&rsquo;s all missed,&mdash;lors, why,
it&rsquo;s a muslin as the Princess Victoree might ha&rsquo; wore; but,&rdquo;
added Bob, flinging it behind him on to the turf, as if to save Mrs
Glegg&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be bought up by the huckster&rsquo;s
wife at Fibb&rsquo;s End,&mdash;that&rsquo;s where <i>it&rsquo;ll</i>
go&mdash;ten shillin&rsquo; for the whole lot&mdash;ten yards, countin&rsquo;
the damaged un&mdash;five-an&rsquo;-twenty shillin&rsquo; &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo;
been the price, not a penny less. But I&rsquo;ll say no more, mum; it&rsquo;s
nothing to you, a piece o&rsquo; muslin like that; you can afford to pay three
times the money for a thing as isn&rsquo;t half so good. It&rsquo;s nets
<i>you</i> talked on; well, I&rsquo;ve got a piece as &rsquo;ull serve you to
make fun on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring me that muslin,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a buff;
I&rsquo;m partial to buff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, but a <i>damaged</i> thing,&rdquo; said Bob, in a tone of
deprecating disgust. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do nothing with it, mum, you&rsquo;d
give it to the cook, I know you would, an&rsquo; it &rsquo;ud be a
pity,&mdash;she&rsquo;d look too much like a lady in it; it&rsquo;s unbecoming
for servants.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fetch it, and let me see you measure it,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg,
authoritatively.
</p>

<p>
Bob obeyed with ostentatious reluctance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See what there is over measure!&rdquo; he said, holding forth the extra
half-yard, while Mrs Glegg was busy examining the damaged yard, and throwing
her head back to see how far the fault would be lost on a distant view.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you six shilling for it,&rdquo; she said, throwing it
down with the air of a person who mentions an ultimatum.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you now, mum, as it &rsquo;ud hurt your feelings to
look at my pack? That damaged bit&rsquo;s turned your stomach now; I see it
has,&rdquo; said Bob, wrapping the muslin up with the utmost quickness, and
apparently about to fasten up his pack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re used to
seein&rsquo; a different sort o&rsquo; article carried by packmen, when you
lived at the stone house. Packs is come down i&rsquo; the world; I told you
that; <i>my</i> goods are for common folks. Mrs Pepper &rsquo;ull give me ten
shillin&rsquo; for that muslin, an&rsquo; be sorry as I didn&rsquo;t ask her
more. Such articles answer i&rsquo; the wearin&rsquo;,&mdash;they keep their
colour till the threads melt away i&rsquo; the wash-tub, an&rsquo; that
won&rsquo;t be while <i>I&rsquo;m</i> a young un.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, seven shilling,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put it out o&rsquo; your mind, mum, now do,&rdquo; said Bob.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bit o&rsquo; net, then, for you to look at before I tie
up my pack, just for you to see what my trade&rsquo;s come to,&mdash;spotted
and sprigged, you see, beautiful but yallow,&mdash;&rsquo;s been lyin&rsquo; by
an&rsquo; got the wrong colour. I could niver ha&rsquo; bought such net, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been yallow. Lors, it&rsquo;s took me a deal o&rsquo; study to
know the vally o&rsquo; such articles; when I begun to carry a pack, I was as
ignirant as a pig; net or calico was all the same to me. I thought them things
the most vally as was the thickest. I was took in dreadful, for I&rsquo;m a
straightforrard chap,&mdash;up to no tricks, mum. I can only say my nose is my
own, for if I went beyond, I should lose myself pretty quick. An&rsquo; I gev
five-an&rsquo;-eightpence for that piece o&rsquo; net,&mdash;if I was to tell
y&rsquo; anything else I should be tellin&rsquo; you fibs,&mdash;an&rsquo;
five-an&rsquo;-eightpence I shall ask of it, not a penny more, for it&rsquo;s a
woman&rsquo;s article, an&rsquo; I like to &rsquo;commodate the women.
Five-an&rsquo;-eightpence for six yards,&mdash;as cheap as if it was only the
dirt on it as was paid for.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind having three yards of it,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mrs
Glegg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s but six altogether,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;No, mum,
it isn&rsquo;t worth your while; you can go to the shop to-morrow an&rsquo; get
the same pattern ready whitened. It&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y three times the money;
what&rsquo;s that to a lady like you?&rdquo; He gave an emphatic tie to his
bundle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, lay me out that muslin,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s eight shilling for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <i>will</i> be jokin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bob, looking up with a
laughing face; &ldquo;I see&rsquo;d you was a pleasant lady when I fust come to
the winder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, put it me out,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if I let you have it for ten shillin&rsquo;, mum, you&rsquo;ll be so
good as not tell nobody. I should be a laughin&rsquo;-stock; the trade
&rsquo;ud hoot me, if they knowed it. I&rsquo;m obliged to make believe as I
ask more nor I do for my goods, else they&rsquo;d find out I was a flat.
I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t insist upo&rsquo; buyin&rsquo; the net, for then
I should ha&rsquo; lost my two best bargains for Mrs Pepper o&rsquo;
Fibb&rsquo;s End, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a rare customer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me look at the net again,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, yearning after the
cheap spots and sprigs, now they were vanishing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t deny <i>you</i>, mum,&rdquo; said Bob handing it
out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh!, see what a pattern now! Real Laceham goods. Now, this is the sort
o&rsquo; article I&rsquo;m recommendin&rsquo; Mr Tom to send out. Lors,
it&rsquo;s a fine thing for anybody as has got a bit o&rsquo; money; these
Laceham goods &rsquo;ud make it breed like maggits. If I was a lady wi&rsquo; a
bit o&rsquo; money!&mdash;why, I know one as put thirty pounds into them
goods,&mdash;a lady wi&rsquo; a cork leg, but as sharp,&mdash;you
wouldn&rsquo;t catch <i>her</i> runnin&rsquo; her head into a sack;
<i>she&rsquo;d</i> see her way clear out o&rsquo; anything afore she&rsquo;d be
in a hurry to start. Well, she let out thirty pound to a young man in the
drapering line, and he laid it out i&rsquo; Laceham goods, an&rsquo; a
shupercargo o&rsquo; my acquinetance (not Salt) took &rsquo;em out, an&rsquo;
she got her eight per zent fust go off; an&rsquo; now you can&rsquo;t hold her
but she must be sendin&rsquo; out carguies wi&rsquo; every ship, till
she&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; as rich as a Jew. Bucks her name is, she
doesn&rsquo;t live i&rsquo; this town. Now then, mum, if you&rsquo;ll please to
give me the net&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s fifteen shilling, then, for the two,&rdquo; said Mrs
Glegg. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a shameful price.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, mum, you&rsquo;ll niver say that when you&rsquo;re upo&rsquo; your
knees i&rsquo; church i&rsquo; five years&rsquo; time. I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo;
you a present o&rsquo; th&rsquo; articles; I am, indeed. That eightpence shaves
off my profits as clean as a razor. Now then, sir,&rdquo; continued Bob,
shouldering his pack, &ldquo;if you please, I&rsquo;ll be glad to go and see
about makin&rsquo; Mr Tom&rsquo;s fortin. Eh, I wish I&rsquo;d got another
twenty pound to lay out <i>my</i>sen; I shouldn&rsquo;t stay to say my
Catechism afore I knowed what to do wi&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop a bit, Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said the lady, as her husband took his
hat, &ldquo;you never <i>will</i> give me the chance o&rsquo; speaking.
You&rsquo;ll go away now, and finish everything about this business, and come
back and tell me it&rsquo;s too late for me to speak. As if I wasn&rsquo;t my
nephey&rsquo;s own aunt, and the head o&rsquo; the family on his mother&rsquo;s
side! and laid by guineas, all full weight, for him, as he&rsquo;ll know who to
respect when I&rsquo;m laid in my coffin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mrs G., say what you mean,&rdquo; said Mr G., hastily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, I desire as nothing may be done without my knowing. I
don&rsquo;t say as I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t venture twenty pounds, if you make out
as everything&rsquo;s right and safe. And if I do, Tom,&rdquo; concluded Mrs
Glegg, turning impressively to her nephew, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll allays
bear it in mind and be grateful for such an aunt. I mean you to pay me
interest, you know; I don&rsquo;t approve o&rsquo; giving; we niver looked for
that in <i>my</i> family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, aunt,&rdquo; said Tom, rather proudly. &ldquo;I prefer having
the money only lent to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well; that&rsquo;s the Dodson sperrit,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg,
rising to get her knitting with the sense that any further remark after this
would be bathos.
</p>

<p>
Salt&mdash;that eminently &ldquo;briny chap&rdquo;&mdash;having been discovered
in a cloud of tobacco-smoke at the Anchor Tavern, Mr Glegg commenced inquiries
which turned out satisfactorily enough to warrant the advance of the
&ldquo;nest-egg,&rdquo; to which aunt Glegg contributed twenty pounds; and in
this modest beginning you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise
surprise you; namely, Tom&rsquo;s accumulation of a fund, unknown to his
father, that promised in no very long time to meet the more tardy process of
saving, and quite cover the deficit. When once his attention had been turned to
this source of gain, Tom determined to make the most of it, and lost no
opportunity of obtaining information and extending his small enterprises. In
not telling his father, he was influenced by that strange mixture of opposite
feelings which often gives equal truth to those who blame an action and those
who admire it,&mdash;partly, it was that disinclination to confidence which is
seen between near kindred, that family repulsion which spoils the most sacred
relations of our lives; partly, it was the desire to surprise his father with a
great joy. He did not see that it would have been better to soothe the interval
with a new hope, and prevent the delirium of a too sudden elation.
</p>

<p>
At the time of Maggie&rsquo;s first meeting with Philip, Tom had already nearly
a hundred and fifty pounds of his own capital; and while they were walking by
the evening light in the Red Deeps, he, by the same evening light, was riding
into Laceham, proud of being on his first journey on behalf of Guest &amp; Co.,
and revolving in his mind all the chances that by the end of another year he
should have doubled his gains, lifted off the obloquy of debt from his
father&rsquo;s name, and perhaps&mdash;for he should be twenty-one&mdash;have
got a new start for himself, on a higher platform of employment. Did he not
desire it? He was quite sure that he did.

<h3><a name="chap35"></a>Chapter III.<br/>
The Wavering Balance</h3>

<p>
I said that Maggie went home that evening from the Red Deeps with a mental
conflict already begun. You have seen clearly enough, in her interview with
Philip, what that conflict was. Here suddenly was an opening in the rocky wall
which shut in the narrow valley of humiliation, where all her prospect was the
remote, unfathomed sky; and some of the memory-haunting earthly delights were
no longer out of her reach. She might have books, converse, affection; she
might hear tidings of the world from which her mind had not yet lost its sense
of exile; and it would be a kindness to Philip too, who was
pitiable,&mdash;clearly not happy. And perhaps here was an opportunity
indicated for making her mind more worthy of its highest service; perhaps the
noblest, completest devoutness could hardly exist without some width of
knowledge; <i>must</i> she always live in this resigned imprisonment? It was so
blameless, so good a thing that there should be friendship between her and
Philip; the motives that forbade it were so unreasonable, so unchristian! But
the severe monotonous warning came again and again,&mdash;that she was losing
the simplicity and clearness of her life by admitting a ground of concealment;
and that, by forsaking the simple rule of renunciation, she was throwing
herself under the seductive guidance of illimitable wants. She thought she had
won strength to obey the warning before she allowed herself the next week to
turn her steps in the evening to the Red Deeps. But while she was resolved to
say an affectionate farewell to Philip, how she looked forward to that evening
walk in the still, fleckered shade of the hollows, away from all that was harsh
and unlovely; to the affectionate, admiring looks that would meet her; to the
sense of comradeship that childish memories would give to wiser, older talk; to
the certainty that Philip would care to hear everything she said, which no one
else cared for! It was a half-hour that it would be very hard to turn her back
upon, with the sense that there would be no other like it. Yet she said what
she meant to say; she looked firm as well as sad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, I have made up my mind; it is right that we should give each
other up, in everything but memory. I could not see you without
concealment&mdash;stay, I know what you are going to say,&mdash;it is other
people&rsquo;s wrong feelings that make concealment necessary; but concealment
is bad, however it may be caused. I feel that it would be bad for me, for us
both. And then, if our secret were discovered, there would be nothing but
misery,&mdash;dreadful anger; and then we must part after all, and it would be
harder, when we were used to seeing each other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s face had flushed, and there was a momentary eagerness of
expression, as if he had been about to resist this decision with all his might.
</p>

<p>
But he controlled himself, and said, with assumed calmness: &ldquo;Well,
Maggie, if we must part, let us try and forget it for one half hour; let us
talk together a little while, for the last time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her hand, and Maggie felt no reason to withdraw it; his quietness made
her all the more sure she had given him great pain, and she wanted to show him
how unwillingly she had given it. They walked together hand in hand in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us sit down in the hollow,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;where we stood
the last time. See how the dog-roses have strewed the ground, and spread their
opal petals over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They sat down at the roots of the slanting ash.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve begun my picture of you among the Scotch firs, Maggie,&rdquo;
said Philip, &ldquo;so you must let me study your face a little, while you
stay,&mdash;since I am not to see it again. Please turn your head this
way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was said in an entreating voice, and it would have been very hard of
Maggie to refuse. The full, lustrous face, with the bright black coronet,
looked down like that of a divinity well pleased to be worshipped, on the
pale-hued, small-featured face that was turned up to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be sitting for my second portrait then,&rdquo; she said,
smiling. &ldquo;Will it be larger than the other?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, much larger. It is an oil-painting. You will look like a tall
Hamadryad, dark and strong and noble, just issued from one of the fir-trees,
when the stems are casting their afternoon shadows on the grass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to think more of painting than of anything now, Philip?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; said Philip, rather sadly; &ldquo;but I think of
too many things,&mdash;sow all sorts of seeds, and get no great harvest from
any one of them. I&rsquo;m cursed with susceptibility in every direction, and
effective faculty in none. I care for painting and music; I care for classic
literature, and mediæval literature, and modern literature; I flutter all ways,
and fly in none.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But surely that is a happiness to have so many tastes,&mdash;to enjoy so
many beautiful things, when they are within your reach,&rdquo; said Maggie,
musingly. &ldquo;It always seemed to me a sort of clever stupidity only to have
one sort of talent,&mdash;almost like a carrier-pigeon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It might be a happiness to have many tastes if I were like other
men,&rdquo; said Philip, bitterly. &ldquo;I might get some power and
distinction by mere mediocrity, as they do; at least I should get those
middling satisfactions which make men contented to do without great ones. I
might think society at St Ogg&rsquo;s agreeable then. But nothing could make
life worth the purchase-money of pain to me, but some faculty that would lift
me above the dead level of provincial existence. Yes, there is one
thing,&mdash;a passion answers as well as a faculty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie did not hear the last words; she was struggling against the
consciousness that Philip&rsquo;s words had set her own discontent vibrating
again as it used to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand what you mean,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though I know so
much less than you do. I used to think I could never bear life if it kept on
being the same every day, and I must always be doing things of no consequence,
and never know anything greater. But, dear Philip, I think we are only like
children that some one who is wiser is taking care of. Is it not right to
resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be denied us? I have found great peace
in that for the last two or three years, even joy in subduing my own
will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, vehemently; &ldquo;and you are shutting
yourself up in a narrow, self-delusive fanaticism, which is only a way of
escaping pain by starving into dulness all the highest powers of your nature.
Joy and peace are not resignation; resignation is the willing endurance of a
pain that is not allayed, that you don&rsquo;t expect to be allayed.
Stupefaction is not resignation; and it is stupefaction to remain in
ignorance,&mdash;to shut up all the avenues by which the life of your
fellow-men might become known to you. I am not resigned; I am not sure that
life is long enough to learn that lesson. <i>You</i> are not resigned; you are
only trying to stupefy yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s lips trembled; she felt there was some truth in what Philip
said, and yet there was a deeper consciousness that, for any immediate
application it had to her conduct, it was no better than falsity. Her double
impression corresponded to the double impulse of the speaker. Philip seriously
believed what he said, but he said it with vehemence because it made an
argument against the resolution that opposed his wishes. But Maggie&rsquo;s
face, made more childlike by the gathering tears, touched him with a tenderer,
less egotistic feeling. He took her hand and said gently:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us think of such things in this short half-hour, Maggie.
Let us only care about being together. We shall be friends in spite of
separation. We shall always think of each other. I shall be glad to live as
long as you are alive, because I shall think there may always come a time when
I can&mdash;when you will let me help you in some way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a dear, good brother you would have been, Philip,&rdquo; said
Maggie, smiling through the haze of tears. &ldquo;I think you would have made
as much fuss about me, and been as pleased for me to love you, as would have
satisfied even me. You would have loved me well enough to bear with me, and
forgive me everything. That was what I always longed that Tom should do. I was
never satisfied with a <i>little</i> of anything. That is why it is better for
me to do without earthly happiness altogether. I never felt that I had enough
music,&mdash;I wanted more instruments playing together; I wanted voices to be
fuller and deeper. Do you ever sing now, Philip?&rdquo; she added abruptly, as
if she had forgotten what went before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every day, almost. But my voice is only
middling, like everything else in me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sing me something,&mdash;just one song. I <i>may</i> listen to that
before I go,&mdash;something you used to sing at Lorton on a Saturday
afternoon, when we had the drawing-room all to ourselves, and I put my apron
over my head to listen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> know,&rdquo; said Philip; and Maggie buried her face in her
hands while he sang <i>sotto voce</i>, &ldquo;Love in her eyes sits
playing,&rdquo; and then said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I won&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; said Maggie, starting up. &ldquo;It
will only haunt me. Let us walk, Philip. I must go home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She moved away, so that he was obliged to rise and follow her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of remonstrance, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
persist in this wilful, senseless privation. It makes me wretched to see you
benumbing and cramping your nature in this way. You were so full of life when
you were a child; I thought you would be a brilliant woman,&mdash;all wit and
bright imagination. And it flashes out in your face still, until you draw that
veil of dull quiescence over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you speak so bitterly to me, Philip?&rdquo; said Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I foresee it will not end well; you can never carry on this
self-torture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall have strength given me,&rdquo; said Maggie, tremulously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you will not, Maggie; no one has strength given to do what is
unnatural. It is mere cowardice to seek safety in negations. No character
becomes strong in that way. You will be thrown into the world some day, and
then every rational satisfaction of your nature that you deny now will assault
you like a savage appetite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie started and paused, looking at Philip with alarm in her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, how dare you shake me in this way? You are a tempter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I am not; but love gives insight, Maggie, and insight often gives
foreboding. <i>Listen</i> to me,&mdash;let <i>me</i> supply you with books; do
let me see you sometimes,&mdash;be your brother and teacher, as you said at
Lorton. It is less wrong that you should see me than that you should be
committing this long suicide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie felt unable to speak. She shook her head and walked on in silence, till
they came to the end of the Scotch firs, and she put out her hand in sign of
parting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you banish me from this place forever, then, Maggie? Surely I may
come and walk in it sometimes? If I meet you by chance, there is no concealment
in that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It is the moment when our resolution seems about to become
irrevocable&mdash;when the fatal iron gates are about to close upon
us&mdash;that tests our strength. Then, after hours of clear reasoning and firm
conviction, we snatch at any sophistry that will nullify our long struggles,
and bring us the defeat that we love better than victory.
</p>

<p>
Maggie felt her heart leap at this subterfuge of Philip&rsquo;s, and there
passed over her face that almost imperceptible shock which accompanies any
relief. He saw it, and they parted in silence.
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s sense of the situation was too complete for him not to be
visited with glancing fears lest he had been intervening too presumptuously in
the action of Maggie&rsquo;s conscience, perhaps for a selfish end. But
no!&mdash;he persuaded himself his end was not selfish. He had little hope that
Maggie would ever return the strong feeling he had for her; and it must be
better for Maggie&rsquo;s future life, when these petty family obstacles to her
freedom had disappeared, that the present should not be entirely sacrificed,
and that she should have some opportunity of culture,&mdash;some interchange
with a mind above the vulgar level of those she was now condemned to live with.
If we only look far enough off for the consequence of our actions, we can
always find some point in the combination of results by which those actions can
be justified; by adopting the point of view of a Providence who arranges
results, or of a philosopher who traces them, we shall find it possible to
obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do what is most agreeable to us in
the present moment. And it was in this way that Philip justified his subtle
efforts to overcome Maggie&rsquo;s true prompting against a concealment that
would introduce doubleness into her own mind, and might cause new misery to
those who had the primary natural claim on her. But there was a surplus of
passion in him that made him half independent of justifying motives. His
longing to see Maggie, and make an element in her life, had in it some of that
savage impulse to snatch an offered joy which springs from a life in which the
mental and bodily constitution have made pain predominate. He had not his full
share in the common good of men; he could not even pass muster with the
insignificant, but must be singled out for pity, and excepted from what was a
matter of course with others. Even to Maggie he was an exception; it was clear
that the thought of his being her lover had never entered her mind.
</p>

<p>
Do not think too hardly of Philip. Ugly and deformed people have great need of
unusual virtues, because they are likely to be extremely uncomfortable without
them; but the theory that unusual virtues spring by a direct consequence out of
personal disadvantages, as animals get thicker wool in severe climates, is
perhaps a little overstrained. The temptations of beauty are much dwelt upon,
but I fancy they only bear the same relation to those of ugliness, as the
temptation to excess at a feast, where the delights are varied for eye and ear
as well as palate, bears to the temptations that assail the desperation of
hunger. Does not the Hunger Tower stand as the type of the utmost trial to what
is human in us?
</p>

<p>
Philip had never been soothed by that mother&rsquo;s love which flows out to us
in the greater abundance because our need is greater, which clings to us the
more tenderly because we are the less likely to be winners in the game of life;
and the sense of his father&rsquo;s affection and indulgence toward him was
marred by the keener perception of his father&rsquo;s faults. Kept aloof from
all practical life as Philip had been, and by nature half feminine in
sensitiveness, he had some of the woman&rsquo;s intolerant repulsion toward
worldliness and the deliberate pursuit of sensual enjoyment; and this one
strong natural tie in his life,&mdash;his relation as a son,&mdash;was like an
aching limb to him. Perhaps there is inevitably something morbid in a human
being who is in any way unfavourably excepted from ordinary conditions, until
the good force has had time to triumph; and it has rarely had time for that at
two-and-twenty. That force was present in Philip in much strength, but the sun
himself looks feeble through the morning mists.

<h3><a name="chap36"></a>Chapter IV.<br/>
Another Love-Scene</h3>

<p>
Early in the following April, nearly a year after that dubious parting you have
just witnessed, you may, if you like, again see Maggie entering the Red Deeps
through the group of Scotch firs. But it is early afternoon and not evening,
and the edge of sharpness in the spring air makes her draw her large shawl
close about her and trip along rather quickly; though she looks round, as
usual, that she may take in the sight of her beloved trees. There is a more
eager, inquiring look in her eyes than there was last June, and a smile is
hovering about her lips, as if some playful speech were awaiting the right
hearer. The hearer was not long in appearing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take back your <i>Corinne</i>,&rdquo; said Maggie, drawing a book from
under her shawl. &ldquo;You were right in telling me she would do me no good;
but you were wrong in thinking I should wish to be like her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you really like to be a tenth Muse, then, Maggie?&rdquo;
said Philip looking up in her face as we look at a first parting in the clouds
that promises us a bright heaven once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Maggie, laughing. &ldquo;The Muses were
uncomfortable goddesses, I think,&mdash;obliged always to carry rolls and
musical instruments about with them. If I carried a harp in this climate, you
know, I must have a green baize cover for it; and I should be sure to leave it
behind me by mistake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You agree with me in not liking Corinne, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t finish the book,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;As soon as I
came to the blond-haired young lady reading in the park, I shut it up, and
determined to read no further. I foresaw that that light-complexioned girl
would win away all the love from Corinne and make her miserable. I&rsquo;m
determined to read no more books where the blond-haired women carry away all
the happiness. I should begin to have a prejudice against them. If you could
give me some story, now, where the dark woman triumphs, it would restore the
balance. I want to avenge Rebecca and Flora MacIvor and Minna, and all the rest
of the dark unhappy ones. Since you are my tutor, you ought to preserve my mind
from prejudices; you are always arguing against prejudices.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person, and
carry away all the love from your cousin Lucy. She is sure to have some
handsome young man of St Ogg&rsquo;s at her feet now; and you have only to
shine upon him&mdash;your fair little cousin will be quite quenched in your
beams.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, that is not pretty of you, to apply my nonsense to anything
real,&rdquo; said Maggie, looking hurt. &ldquo;As if I, with my old gowns and
want of all accomplishments, could be a rival of dear little Lucy,&mdash;who
knows and does all sorts of charming things, and is ten times prettier than I
am,&mdash;even if I were odious and base enough to wish to be her rival.
Besides, I never go to aunt Deane&rsquo;s when any one is there; it is only
because dear Lucy is good, and loves me, that she comes to see me, and will
have me go to see her sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, with surprise, &ldquo;it is not like you to
take playfulness literally. You must have been in St Ogg&rsquo;s this morning,
and brought away a slight infection of dulness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling, &ldquo;if you meant that for a joke,
it was a poor one; but I thought it was a very good reproof. I thought you
wanted to remind me that I am vain, and wish every one to admire me most. But
it isn&rsquo;t for that that I&rsquo;m jealous for the dark women,&mdash;not
because I&rsquo;m dark myself; it&rsquo;s because I always care the most about
the unhappy people. If the blond girl were forsaken, I should like <i>her</i>
best. I always take the side of the rejected lover in the stories.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you would never have the heart to reject one yourself, should you,
Maggie?&rdquo; said Philip, flushing a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Maggie, hesitatingly. Then with a bright
smile, &ldquo;I think perhaps I could if he were very conceited; and yet, if he
got extremely humiliated afterward, I should relent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered, Maggie,&rdquo; Philip said, with some effort,
&ldquo;whether you wouldn&rsquo;t really be more likely to love a man that
other women were not likely to love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would depend on what they didn&rsquo;t like him for,&rdquo; said
Maggie, laughing. &ldquo;He might be very disagreeable. He might look at me
through an eye-glass stuck in his eye, making a hideous face, as young Torry
does. I should think other women are not fond of that; but I never felt any
pity for young Torry. I&rsquo;ve never any pity for conceited people, because I
think they carry their comfort about with them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But suppose, Maggie,&mdash;suppose it was a man who was not conceited,
who felt he had nothing to be conceited about; who had been marked from
childhood for a peculiar kind of suffering, and to whom you were the day-star
of his life; who loved you, worshipped you, so entirely that he felt it
happiness enough for him if you would let him see you at rare
moments&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip paused with a pang of dread lest his confession should cut short this
very happiness,&mdash;a pang of the same dread that had kept his love mute
through long months. A rush of self-consciousness told him that he was besotted
to have said all this. Maggie&rsquo;s manner this morning had been as
unconstrained and indifferent as ever.
</p>

<p>
But she was not looking indifferent now. Struck with the unusual emotion in
Philip&rsquo;s tone, she had turned quickly to look at him; and as he went on
speaking, a great change came over her face,&mdash;a flush and slight spasm of
the features, such as we see in people who hear some news that will require
them to readjust their conceptions of the past. She was quite silent, and
walking on toward the trunk of a fallen tree, she sat down, as if she had no
strength to spare for her muscles. She was trembling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; said Philip, getting more and more alarmed in every fresh
moment of silence, &ldquo;I was a fool to say it; forget that I&rsquo;ve said
it. I shall be contented if things can be as they were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The distress with which he spoke urged Maggie to say something. &ldquo;I am so
surprised, Philip; I had not thought of it.&rdquo; And the effort to say this
brought the tears down too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has it made you hate me, Maggie?&rdquo; said Philip, impetuously.
&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a presumptuous fool?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip!&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;how can you think I have such
feelings? As if I were not grateful for <i>any</i> love. But&mdash;but I had
never thought of your being my lover. It seemed so far off&mdash;like a
dream&mdash;only like one of the stories one imagines&mdash;that I should ever
have a lover.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then can you bear to think of me as your lover, Maggie?&rdquo; said
Philip, seating himself by her, and taking her hand, in the elation of a sudden
hope. &ldquo;<i>Do</i> you love me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie turned rather pale; this direct question seemed not easy to answer. But
her eyes met Philip&rsquo;s, which were in this moment liquid and beautiful
with beseeching love. She spoke with hesitation, yet with sweet, simple,
girlish tenderness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I could hardly love any one better; there is nothing but what I
love you for.&rdquo; She paused a little while, and then added: &ldquo;But it
will be better for us not to say any more about it, won&rsquo;t it, dear
Philip? You know we couldn&rsquo;t even be friends, if our friendship were
discovered. I have never felt that I was right in giving way about seeing you,
though it has been so precious to me in some ways; and now the fear comes upon
me strongly again, that it will lead to evil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But no evil has come, Maggie; and if you had been guided by that fear
before, you would only have lived through another dreary, benumbing year,
instead of reviving into your real self.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie shook her head. &ldquo;It has been very sweet, I know,&mdash;all the
talking together, and the books, and the feeling that I had the walk to look
forward to, when I could tell you the thoughts that had come into my head while
I was away from you. But it has made me restless; it has made me think a great
deal about the world; and I have impatient thoughts again,&mdash;I get weary of
my home; and then it cuts me to the heart afterward, that I should ever have
felt weary of my father and mother. I think what you call being benumbed was
better&mdash;better for me&mdash;for then my selfish desires were
benumbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had risen again, and was walking backward and forward impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Maggie, you have wrong ideas of self-conquest, as I&rsquo;ve often
told you. What you call self-conquest&mdash;binding and deafening yourself to
all but one train of impressions&mdash;is only the culture of monomania in a
nature like yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had spoken with some irritation, but now he sat down by her again and took
her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of the past now, Maggie; think only of our love. If
you can really cling to me with all your heart, every obstacle will be overcome
in time; we need only wait. I can live on hope. Look at me, Maggie; tell me
again it is possible for you to love me. Don&rsquo;t look away from me to that
cloven tree; it is a bad omen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned her large dark glance upon him with a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, Maggie, say one kind word, or else you were better to me at
Lorton. You asked me if I should like you to kiss me,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
remember?&mdash;and you promised to kiss me when you met me again. You never
kept the promise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The recollection of that childish time came as a sweet relief to Maggie. It
made the present moment less strange to her. She kissed him almost as simply
and quietly as she had done when she was twelve years old. Philip&rsquo;s eyes
flashed with delight, but his next words were words of discontent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem happy enough, Maggie; you are forcing yourself to
say you love me, out of pity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Philip,&rdquo; said Maggie, shaking her head, in her old childish
way; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth. It is all new and strange to me;
but I don&rsquo;t think I could love any one better than I love you. I should
like always to live with you&mdash;to make you happy. I have always been happy
when I have been with you. There is only one thing I will not do for your sake;
I will never do anything to wound my father. You must never ask that from
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Maggie, I will ask nothing; I will bear everything; I&rsquo;ll wait
another year only for a kiss, if you will only give me the first place in your
heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make you wait so
long as that.&rdquo; But then, looking serious again, she added, as she rose
from her seat,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what would your own father say, Philip? Oh, it is quite impossible
we can ever be more than friends,&mdash;brother and sister in secret, as we
have been. Let us give up thinking of everything else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Maggie, I can&rsquo;t give you up,&mdash;unless you are deceiving
me; unless you really only care for me as if I were your brother. Tell me the
truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed I do, Philip. What happiness have I ever had so great as being
with you,&mdash;since I was a little girl,&mdash;the days Tom was good to me?
And your mind is a sort of world to me; you can tell me all I want to know. I
think I should never be tired of being with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were walking hand in hand, looking at each other; Maggie, indeed, was
hurrying along, for she felt it time to be gone. But the sense that their
parting was near made her more anxious lest she should have unintentionally
left some painful impression on Philip&rsquo;s mind. It was one of those
dangerous moments when speech is at once sincere and deceptive; when feeling,
rising high above its average depth, leaves floodmarks which are never reached
again.
</p>

<p>
They stopped to part among the Scotch firs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then my life will be filled with hope, Maggie, and I shall be happier
than other men, in spite of all? We <i>do</i> belong to each other&mdash;for
always&mdash;whether we are apart or together?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Philip; I should like never to part; I should like to make your
life very happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am waiting for something else. I wonder whether it will come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie smiled, with glistening tears, and then stooped her tall head to kiss
the pale face that was full of pleading, timid love,&mdash;like a
woman&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
She had a moment of real happiness then,&mdash;a moment of belief that, if
there were sacrifice in this love, it was all the richer and more satisfying.
</p>

<p>
She turned away and hurried home, feeling that in the hour since she had
trodden this road before, a new era had begun for her. The tissue of vague
dreams must now get narrower and narrower, and all the threads of thought and
emotion be gradually absorbed in the woof of her actual daily life.

The Cloven Tree</h3>

<p>
Secrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme our fear
has sketched out. Fear is almost always haunted by terrible dramatic scenes,
which recur in spite of the best-argued probabilities against them; and during
a year that Maggie had had the burthen of concealment on her mind, the
possibility of discovery had continually presented itself under the form of a
sudden meeting with her father or Tom when she was walking with Philip in the
Red Deeps. She was aware that this was not one of the most likely events; but
it was the scene that most completely symbolised her inward dread. Those slight
indirect suggestions which are dependent on apparently trivial coincidences and
incalculable states of mind, are the favourite machinery of Fact, but are not
the stuff in which Imagination is apt to work.
</p>

<p>
Certainly one of the persons about whom Maggie&rsquo;s fears were furthest from
troubling themselves was her aunt Pullet, on whom, seeing that she did not live
in St Ogg&rsquo;s, and was neither sharp-eyed nor sharp-tempered, it would
surely have been quite whimsical of them to fix rather than on aunt Glegg. And
yet the channel of fatality&mdash;the pathway of the lightning&mdash;was no
other than aunt Pullet. She did not live at St Ogg&rsquo;s, but the road from
Garum Firs lay by the Red Deeps, at the end opposite that by which Maggie
entered.
</p>

<p>
The day after Maggie&rsquo;s last meeting with Philip, being a Sunday on which
Mr Pullet was bound to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at St Ogg&rsquo;s
church, Mrs Pullet made this the occasion of dining with sister Glegg, and
taking tea with poor sister Tulliver. Sunday was the one day in the week on
which Tom was at home in the afternoon; and today the brighter spirits he had
been in of late had flowed over in unusually cheerful open chat with his
father, and in the invitation, &ldquo;Come, Magsie, you come too!&rdquo; when
he strolled out with his mother in the garden to see the advancing
cherry-blossoms. He had been better pleased with Maggie since she had been less
odd and ascetic; he was even getting rather proud of her; several persons had
remarked in his hearing that his sister was a very fine girl. To-day there was
a peculiar brightness in her face, due in reality to an undercurrent of
excitement, which had as much doubt and pain as pleasure in it; but it might
pass for a sign of happiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look very well, my dear,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet, shaking her head
sadly, as they sat round the tea-table. &ldquo;I niver thought your girl
&rsquo;ud be so good-looking, Bessy. But you must wear pink, my dear; that blue
thing as your aunt Glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower. Jane never
<i>was</i> tasty. Why don&rsquo;t you wear that gown o&rsquo; mine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is so pretty and so smart, aunt. I think it&rsquo;s too showy for
me,&mdash;at least for my other clothes, that I must wear with it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, it &rsquo;ud be unbecoming if it wasn&rsquo;t well known
you&rsquo;ve got them belonging to you as can afford to give you such things
when they&rsquo;ve done with &rsquo;em themselves. It stands to reason I must
give my own niece clothes now and then,&mdash;such things as <i>I</i> buy every
year, and never wear anything out. And as for Lucy, there&rsquo;s no giving to
her, for she&rsquo;s got everything o&rsquo; the choicest; sister Deane may
well hold her head up,&mdash;though she looks dreadful yallow, poor
thing&mdash;I doubt this liver complaint &rsquo;ull carry her off. That&rsquo;s
what this new vicar, this Dr Kenn, said in the funeral sermon to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s a wonderful preacher, by all account,&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
he, Sophy?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Lucy had got a collar on this blessed day,&rdquo; continued Mrs
Pullet, with her eyes fixed in a ruminating manner, &ldquo;as I don&rsquo;t say
I haven&rsquo;t got as good, but I must look out my best to match it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Lucy&rsquo;s called the bell o&rsquo; St Ogg&rsquo;s, they say;
that&rsquo;s a cur&rsquo;ous word,&rdquo; observed Mr Pullet, on whom the
mysteries of etymology sometimes fell with an oppressive weight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, jealous for Maggie, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a
small thing, not much of a figure. But fine feathers make fine birds. I see
nothing to admire so much in those diminutive women; they look silly by the
side o&rsquo; the men,&mdash;out o&rsquo; proportion. When I chose my wife, I
chose her the right size,&mdash;neither too little nor too big.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The poor wife, with her withered beauty, smiled complacently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the men aren&rsquo;t <i>all</i> big,&rdquo; said uncle Pullet, not
without some self-reference; &ldquo;a young fellow may be good-looking and yet
not be a six-foot, like Master Tom here.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s poor talking about littleness and bigness,&mdash;anybody
may think it&rsquo;s a mercy they&rsquo;re straight,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that mismade son o&rsquo; Lawyer Wakem&rsquo;s, I saw him
at church to-day. Dear, dear! to think o&rsquo; the property he&rsquo;s like to
have; and they say he&rsquo;s very queer and lonely, doesn&rsquo;t like much
company. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he goes out of his mind; for we never come
along the road but he&rsquo;s a-scrambling out o&rsquo; the trees and brambles
at the Red Deeps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This wide statement, by which Mrs Pullet represented the fact that she had
twice seen Philip at the spot indicated, produced an effect on Maggie which was
all the stronger because Tom sate opposite her, and she was intensely anxious
to look indifferent. At Philip&rsquo;s name she had blushed, and the blush
deepened every instant from consciousness, until the mention of the Red Deeps
made her feel as if the whole secret were betrayed, and she dared not even hold
her tea-spoon lest she should show how she trembled. She sat with her hands
clasped under the table, not daring to look round. Happily, her father was
seated on the same side with herself, beyond her uncle Pullet, and could not
see her face without stooping forward. Her mother&rsquo;s voice brought the
first relief, turning the conversation; for Mrs Tulliver was always alarmed
when the name of Wakem was mentioned in her husband&rsquo;s presence. Gradually
Maggie recovered composure enough to look up; her eyes met Tom&rsquo;s, but he
turned away his head immediately; and she went to bed that night wondering if
he had gathered any suspicion from her confusion. Perhaps not; perhaps he would
think it was only her alarm at her aunt&rsquo;s mention of Wakem before her
father; that was the interpretation her mother had put on it. To her father,
Wakem was like a disfiguring disease, of which he was obliged to endure the
consciousness, but was exasperated to have the existence recognised by others;
and no amount of sensitiveness in her about her father could be surprising,
Maggie thought.
</p>

<p>
But Tom was too keen-sighted to rest satisfied with such an interpretation; he
had seen clearly enough that there was something distinct from anxiety about
her father in Maggie&rsquo;s excessive confusion. In trying to recall all the
details that could give shape to his suspicions, he remembered only lately
hearing his mother scold Maggie for walking in the Red Deeps when the ground
was wet, and bringing home shoes clogged with red soil; still Tom, retaining
all his old repulsion for Philip&rsquo;s deformity, shrank from attributing to
his sister the probability of feeling more than a friendly interest in such an
unfortunate exception to the common run of men. Tom&rsquo;s was a nature which
had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional. A love for a
deformed man would be odious in any woman, in a sister intolerable. But if she
had been carrying on any kind of intercourse whatever with Philip, a stop must
be put to it at once; she was disobeying her father&rsquo;s strongest feelings
and her brother&rsquo;s express commands, besides compromising herself by
secret meetings. He left home the next morning in that watchful state of mind
which turns the most ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon, about half-past three o&rsquo;clock, Tom was standing on the
wharf, talking with Bob Jakin about the probability of the good ship Adelaide
coming in, in a day or two, with results highly important to both of them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo; said Bob, parenthetically, as he looked over the fields on
the other side of the river, &ldquo;there goes that crooked young Wakem. I know
him or his shadder as far off as I can see &rsquo;em; I&rsquo;m allays lighting
on him o&rsquo; that side the river.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A sudden thought seemed to have darted through Tom&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;I must
go, Bob,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to attend to,&rdquo;
hurrying off to the warehouse, where he left notice for some one to take his
place; he was called away home on peremptory business.
</p>

<p>
The swiftest pace and the shortest road took him to the gate, and he was
pausing to open it deliberately, that he might walk into the house with an
appearance of perfect composure, when Maggie came out at the front door in
bonnet and shawl. His conjecture was fulfilled, and he waited for her at the
gate. She started violently when she saw him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom, how is it you are come home? Is there anything the matter?&rdquo;
Maggie spoke in a low, tremulous voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m come to walk with you to the Red Deeps, and meet Philip
Wakem,&rdquo; said Tom, the central fold in his brow, which had become habitual
with him, deepening as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
Maggie stood helpless, pale and cold. By some means, then, Tom knew everything.
At last she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; and turned round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you are; but I want to speak to you first. Where is my
father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out on horseback.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And my mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the yard, I think, with the poultry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can go in, then, without her seeing me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked in together, and Tom, entering the parlour, said to Maggie,
&ldquo;Come in here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She obeyed, and he closed the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Maggie, tell me this instant everything that has passed between you
and Philip Wakem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does my father know anything?&rdquo; said Maggie, still trembling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom indignantly. &ldquo;But he <i>shall</i> know, if you
attempt to use deceit toward me any further.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to use deceit,&rdquo; said Maggie, flushing into
resentment at hearing this word applied to her conduct.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me the whole truth, then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you know it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind whether I know it or not. Tell me exactly what has happened,
or my father shall know everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell it for my father&rsquo;s sake, then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it becomes you to profess affection for your father, when you have
despised his strongest feelings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never do wrong, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, tauntingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not if I know it,&rdquo; answered Tom, with proud sincerity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I have nothing to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed
between you and Philip Wakem. When did you first meet him in the Red
Deeps?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A year ago,&rdquo; said Maggie, quietly. Tom&rsquo;s severity gave her a
certain fund of defiance, and kept her sense of error in abeyance. &ldquo;You
need ask me no more questions. We have been friendly a year. We have met and
walked together often. He has lent me books.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Tom, looking straight at her with his frown.
</p>

<p>
Maggie paused a moment; then, determined to make an end of Tom&rsquo;s right to
accuse her of deceit, she said haughtily:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not quite all. On Saturday he told me that he loved me. I
didn&rsquo;t think of it before then; I had only thought of him as an old
friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you <i>encouraged</i> him?&rdquo; said Tom, with an expression of
disgust.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told him that I loved him too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom was silent a few moments, looking on the ground and frowning, with his
hands in his pockets. At last he looked up and said coldly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then, Maggie, there are but two courses for you to
take,&mdash;either you vow solemnly to me, with your hand on my father&rsquo;s
Bible, that you will never have another meeting or speak another word in
private with Philip Wakem, or you refuse, and I tell my father everything; and
this month, when by my exertions he might be made happy once more, you will
cause him the blow of knowing that you are a disobedient, deceitful daughter,
who throws away her own respectability by clandestine meetings with the son of
a man that has helped to ruin her father. Choose!&rdquo; Tom ended with cold
decision, going up to the large Bible, drawing it forward, and opening it at
the fly-leaf, where the writing was.
</p>

<p>
It was a crushing alternative to Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said, urged out of pride into pleading,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me that. I will promise you to give up all intercourse
with Philip, if you will let me see him once, or even only write to him and
explain everything,&mdash;to give it up as long as it would ever cause any pain
to my father. I feel something for Philip too. <i>He</i> is not happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to hear anything of your feelings; I have said
exactly what I mean. Choose, and quickly, lest my mother should come in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I give you my word, that will be as strong a bond to me as if I laid
my hand on the Bible. I don&rsquo;t require that to bind me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do what <i>I</i> require,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust
you, Maggie. There is no consistency in you. Put your hand on this Bible, and
say, &lsquo;I renounce all private speech and intercourse with Philip Wakem
from this time forth.&rsquo; Else you will bring shame on us all, and grief on
my father; and what is the use of my exerting myself and giving up everything
else for the sake of paying my father&rsquo;s debts, if you are to bring
madness and vexation on him, just when he might be easy and hold up his head
once more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Tom, <i>will</i> the debts be paid soon?&rdquo; said Maggie,
clasping her hands, with a sudden flash of joy across her wretchedness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If things turn out as I expect,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he
added, his voice trembling with indignation, &ldquo;while I have been
contriving and working that my father may have some peace of mind before he
dies,&mdash;working for the respectability of our family,&mdash;you have done
all you can to destroy both.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie felt a deep movement of compunction; for the moment, her mind ceased to
contend against what she felt to be cruel and unreasonable, and in her
self-blame she justified her brother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;it was wrong of me; but I
was so lonely, and I was sorry for Philip. And I think enmity and hatred are
wicked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Your duty was clear enough. Say no
more; but promise, in the words I told you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>must</i> speak to Philip once more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will go with me now and speak to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give you my word not to meet him or write to him again without your
knowledge. That is the only thing I will say. I will put my hand on the Bible
if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say it, then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie laid her hand on the page of manuscript and repeated the promise. Tom
closed the book, and said, &ldquo;Now let us go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Not a word was spoken as they walked along. Maggie was suffering in
anticipation of what Philip was about to suffer, and dreading the galling words
that would fall on him from Tom&rsquo;s lips; but she felt it was in vain to
attempt anything but submission. Tom had his terrible clutch on her conscience
and her deepest dread; she writhed under the demonstrable truth of the
character he had given to her conduct, and yet her whole soul rebelled against
it as unfair from its incompleteness. He, meanwhile, felt the impetus of his
indignation diverted toward Philip. He did not know how much of an old boyish
repulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity was concerned in the bitter
severity of the words by which he meant to do the duty of a son and a brother.
Tom was not given to inquire subtly into his own motives any more than into
other matters of an intangible kind; he was quite sure that his own motives as
well as actions were good, else he would have had nothing to do with them.
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s only hope was that something might, for the first time, have
prevented Philip from coming. Then there would be delay,&mdash;then she might
get Tom&rsquo;s permission to write to him. Her heart beat with double violence
when they got under the Scotch firs. It was the last moment of suspense, she
thought; Philip always met her soon after she got beyond them. But they passed
across the more open green space, and entered the narrow bushy path by the
mound. Another turning, and they came so close upon him that both Tom and
Philip stopped suddenly within a yard of each other. There was a moment&rsquo;s
silence, in which Philip darted a look of inquiry at Maggie&rsquo;s face. He
saw an answer there, in the pale, parted lips, and the terrified tension of the
large eyes. Her imagination, always rushing extravagantly beyond an immediate
impression, saw her tall, strong brother grasping the feeble Philip bodily,
crushing him and trampling on him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?&rdquo;
Tom said, in a voice of harsh scorn, as soon as Philip&rsquo;s eyes were turned
on him again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; answered Philip, haughtily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mean? Stand farther from me, lest I should lay hands on you, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean. I mean, taking advantage of a young
girl&rsquo;s foolishness and ignorance to get her to have secret meetings with
you. I mean, daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has a
good and honest name to support.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I deny that,&rdquo; interrupted Philip, impetuously. &ldquo;I could
never trifle with anything that affected your sister&rsquo;s happiness. She is
dearer to me than she is to you; I honour her more than you can ever honour
her; I would give up my life to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk high-flown nonsense to me, sir! Do you mean to pretend
that you didn&rsquo;t know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week
after week? Do you pretend you had any right to make professions of love to
her, even if you had been a fit husband for her, when neither her father nor
your father would ever consent to a marriage between you? And
<i>you</i>,&mdash;<i>you</i> to try and worm yourself into the affections of a
handsome girl who is not eighteen, and has been shut out from the world by her
father&rsquo;s misfortunes! That&rsquo;s your crooked notion of honour, is it?
I call it base treachery; I call it taking advantage of circumstances to win
what&rsquo;s too good for you,&mdash;what you&rsquo;d never get by fair
means.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is manly of you to talk in this way to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Philip,
bitterly, his whole frame shaken by violent emotions. &ldquo;Giants have an
immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse. You are incapable even of
understanding what I feel for your sister. I feel so much for her that I could
even desire to be at friendship with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should be very sorry to understand your feelings,&rdquo; said Tom,
with scorching contempt. &ldquo;What I wish is that you should understand
<i>me</i>,&mdash;that I shall take care of <i>my</i> sister, and that if you
dare to make the least attempt to come near her, or to write to her, or to keep
the slightest hold on her mind, your puny, miserable body, that ought to have
put some modesty into your mind, shall not protect you. I&rsquo;ll thrash you;
I&rsquo;ll hold you up to public scorn. Who wouldn&rsquo;t laugh at the idea of
<i>your</i> turning lover to a fine girl?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He burst out, in a
convulsed voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stay, Maggie!&rdquo; said Philip, making a strong effort to speak. Then
looking at Tom, &ldquo;You have dragged your sister here, I suppose, that she
may stand by while you threaten and insult me. These naturally seemed to you
the right means to influence me. But you are mistaken. Let your sister speak.
If she says she is bound to give me up, I shall abide by her wishes to the
slightest word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was for my father&rsquo;s sake, Philip,&rdquo; said Maggie,
imploringly. &ldquo;Tom threatens to tell my father, and he couldn&rsquo;t bear
it; I have promised, I have vowed solemnly, that we will not have any
intercourse without my brother&rsquo;s knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is enough, Maggie. <i>I</i> shall not change; but I wish you to hold
yourself entirely free. But trust me; remember that I can never seek for
anything but good to what belongs to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, exasperated by this attitude of Philip&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;you can talk of seeking good for her and what belongs to her now; did
you seek her good before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did,&mdash;at some risk, perhaps. But I wished her to have a friend
for life,&mdash;who would cherish her, who would do her more justice than a
coarse and narrow-minded brother, that she has always lavished her affections
on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my way of befriending her is different from yours; and I&rsquo;ll
tell you what is my way. I&rsquo;ll save her from disobeying and disgracing her
father; I&rsquo;ll save her from throwing herself away on you,&mdash;from
making herself a laughing-stock,&mdash;from being flouted by a man like
<i>your</i> father, because she&rsquo;s not good enough for his son. You know
well enough what sort of justice and cherishing you were preparing for her.
I&rsquo;m not to be imposed upon by fine words; I can see what actions mean.
Come away, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He seized Maggie&rsquo;s right wrist as he spoke, and she put out her left
hand. Philip clasped it an instant, with one eager look, and then hurried away.
</p>

<p>
Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He was still holding her
wrist tightly, as if he were compelling a culprit from the scene of action. At
last Maggie, with a violent snatch, drew her hand away, and her pent-up,
long-gathered irritation burst into utterance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose that I think you are right, Tom, or that I bow to
your will. I despise the feelings you have shown in speaking to Philip; I
detest your insulting, unmanly allusions to his deformity. You have been
reproaching other people all your life; you have been always sure you yourself
are right. It is because you have not a mind large enough to see that there is
anything better than your own conduct and your own petty aims.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Tom, coolly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that your
conduct is better, or your aims either. If your conduct, and Philip
Wakem&rsquo;s conduct, has been right, why are you ashamed of its being known?
Answer me that. I know what I have aimed at in my conduct, and I&rsquo;ve
succeeded; pray, what good has your conduct brought to you or any one
else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to defend myself,&rdquo; said Maggie, still with
vehemence: &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve been wrong,&mdash;often, continually. But
yet, sometimes when I have done wrong, it has been because I have feelings that
you would be the better for, if you had them. If <i>you</i> were in fault ever,
if you had done anything very wrong, I should be sorry for the pain it brought
you; I should not want punishment to be heaped on you. But you have always
enjoyed punishing me; you have always been hard and cruel to me; even when I
was a little girl, and always loved you better than any one else in the world,
you would let me go crying to bed without forgiving me. You have no pity; you
have no sense of your own imperfection and your own sins. It is a sin to be
hard; it is not fitting for a mortal, for a Christian. You are nothing but a
Pharisee. You thank God for nothing but your own virtues; you think they are
great enough to win you everything else. You have not even a vision of feelings
by the side of which your shining virtues are mere darkness!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, with cold scorn, &ldquo;if your feelings are so
much better than mine, let me see you show them in some other way than by
conduct that&rsquo;s likely to disgrace us all,&mdash;than by ridiculous
flights first into one extreme and then into another. Pray, how have you shown
your love, that you talk of, either to me or my father? By disobeying and
deceiving us. I have a different way of showing my affection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you are a man, Tom, and have power, and can do something in the
world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, if you can do nothing, submit to those that can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I <i>will</i> submit to what I acknowledge and feel to be right. I
will submit even to what is unreasonable from my father, but I will not submit
to it from you. You boast of your virtues as if they purchased you a right to
be cruel and unmanly, as you&rsquo;ve been to-day. Don&rsquo;t suppose I would
give up Philip Wakem in obedience to you. The deformity you insult would make
me cling to him and care for him the more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well; that is your view of things.&rdquo; said Tom, more coldly
than ever; &ldquo;you need say no more to show me what a wide distance there is
between us. Let us remember that in future, and be silent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom went back to St Ogg&rsquo;s, to fulfill an appointment with his uncle
Deane, and receive directions about a journey on which he was to set out the
next morning.
</p>

<p>
Maggie went up to her own room to pour out all that indignant remonstrance,
against which Tom&rsquo;s mind was close barred, in bitter tears. Then, when
the first burst of unsatisfied anger was gone by, came the recollection of that
quiet time before the pleasure which had ended in to-day&rsquo;s misery had
perturbed the clearness and simplicity of her life. She used to think in that
time that she had made great conquests, and won a lasting stand on serene
heights above worldly temptations and conflict. And here she was down again in
the thick of a hot strife with her own and others&rsquo; passions. Life was not
so short, then, and perfect rest was not so near as she had dreamed when she
was two years younger. There was more struggle for her, and perhaps more
falling. If she had felt that she was entirely wrong, and that Tom had been
entirely right, she could sooner have recovered more inward harmony; but now
her penitence and submission were constantly obstructed by resentment that
would present itself to her no otherwise than as a just indignation. Her heart
bled for Philip; she went on recalling the insults that had been flung at him
with so vivid a conception of what he had felt under them, that it was almost
like a sharp bodily pain to her, making her beat the floor with her foot and
tighten her fingers on her palm.
</p>

<p>
And yet, how was it that she was now and then conscious of a certain dim
background of relief in the forced separation from Philip? Surely it was only
because the sense of a deliverance from concealment was welcome at any cost.

The Hard-Won Triumph</h3>

<p>
Three weeks later, when Dorlcote Mill was at its prettiest moment in all the
year,&mdash;the great chestnuts in blossom, and the grass all deep and
daisied,&mdash;Tom Tulliver came home to it earlier than usual in the evening,
and as he passed over the bridge, he looked with the old deep-rooted affection
at the respectable red brick house, which always seemed cheerful and inviting
outside, let the rooms be as bare and the hearts as sad as they might inside.
There is a very pleasant light in Tom&rsquo;s blue-gray eyes as he glances at
the house-windows; that fold in his brow never disappears, but it is not
unbecoming; it seems to imply a strength of will that may possibly be without
harshness, when the eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression. His firm
step becomes quicker, and the corners of his mouth rebel against the
compression which is meant to forbid a smile.
</p>

<p>
The eyes in the parlour were not turned toward the bridge just then, and the
group there was sitting in unexpectant silence,&mdash;Mr Tulliver in his
arm-chair, tired with a long ride, and ruminating with a worn look, fixed
chiefly on Maggie, who was bending over her sewing while her mother was making
the tea.
</p>

<p>
They all looked up with surprise when they heard the well-known foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s up now, Tom?&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit earlier than usual.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there was nothing more for me to do, so I came away. Well,
mother!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom went up to his mother and kissed her, a sign of unusual good-humour with
him. Hardly a word or look had passed between him and Maggie in all the three
weeks; but his usual incommunicativeness at home prevented this from being
noticeable to their parents.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Tom, when they had finished tea, &ldquo;do you know
exactly how much money there is in the tin box?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only a hundred and ninety-three pound,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought less o&rsquo; late; but young fellows like to have
their own way with their money. Though I didn&rsquo;t do as I liked before
<i>I</i> was of age.&rdquo; He spoke with rather timid discontent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite sure that&rsquo;s the sum, father?&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;I wish you would take the trouble to fetch the tin box down. I think you
have perhaps made a mistake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How should I make a mistake?&rdquo; said his father, sharply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve counted it often enough; but I can fetch it, if you
won&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was always an incident Mr Tulliver liked, in his gloomy life, to fetch the
tin box and count the money.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go out of the room, mother,&rdquo; said Tom, as he saw her
moving when his father was gone upstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t Maggie to go?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver; &ldquo;because
somebody must take away the things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just as she likes,&rdquo; said Tom indifferently.
</p>

<p>
That was a cutting word to Maggie. Her heart had leaped with the sudden
conviction that Tom was going to tell their father the debts could be paid; and
Tom would have let her be absent when that news was told! But she carried away
the tray and came back immediately. The feeling of injury on her own behalf
could not predominate at that moment.
</p>

<p>
Tom drew to the corner of the table near his father when the tin box was set
down and opened, and the red evening light falling on them made conspicuous the
worn, sour gloom of the dark-eyed father and the suppressed joy in the face of
the fair-complexioned son. The mother and Maggie sat at the other end of the
table, the one in blank patience, the other in palpitating expectation.
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver counted out the money, setting it in order on the table, and then
said, glancing sharply at Tom:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There now! you see I was right enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused, looking at the money with bitter despondency.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more nor three hundred wanting; it&rsquo;ll be a fine
while before <i>I</i> can save that. Losing that forty-two pound wi&rsquo; the
corn was a sore job. This world&rsquo;s been too many for me. It&rsquo;s took
four year to lay <i>this</i> by; it&rsquo;s much if I&rsquo;m above ground for
another four year. I must trusten to you to pay &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he went on,
with a trembling voice, &ldquo;if you keep i&rsquo; the same mind now
you&rsquo;re coming o&rsquo; age. But you&rsquo;re like enough to bury me
first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked up in Tom&rsquo;s face with a querulous desire for some assurance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; said Tom, speaking with energetic decision, though
there was tremor discernible in his voice too, &ldquo;you will live to see the
debts all paid. You shall pay them with your own hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His tone implied something more than mere hopefulness or resolution. A slight
electric shock seemed to pass through Mr Tulliver, and he kept his eyes fixed
on Tom with a look of eager inquiry, while Maggie, unable to restrain herself,
rushed to her father&rsquo;s side and knelt down by him. Tom was silent a
little while before he went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good while ago, my uncle Glegg lent me a little money to trade with,
and that has answered. I have three hundred and twenty pounds in the
bank.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His mother&rsquo;s arms were round his neck as soon as the last words were
uttered, and she said, half crying:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my boy, I knew you&rsquo;d make iverything right again, when you got
a man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But his father was silent; the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of speech.
Both Tom and Maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of joy might even be
fatal. But the blessed relief of tears came. The broad chest heaved, the
muscles of the face gave way, and the gray-haired man burst into loud sobs. The
fit of weeping gradually subsided, and he sat quiet, recovering the regularity
of his breathing. At last he looked up at his wife and said, in a gentle tone:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bessy, you must come and kiss me now&mdash;the lad has made you amends.
You&rsquo;ll see a bit o&rsquo; comfort again, belike.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When she had kissed him, and he had held her hand a minute, his thoughts went
back to the money.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d brought me the money to look at, Tom,&rdquo; he said,
fingering the sovereigns on the table; &ldquo;I should ha&rsquo; felt
surer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall see it to-morrow, father,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;My uncle
Deane has appointed the creditors to meet to-morrow at the Golden Lion, and he
has ordered a dinner for them at two o&rsquo;clock. My uncle Glegg and he will
both be there. It was advertised in the &lsquo;Messenger&rsquo; on
Saturday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then Wakem knows on&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, his eye kindling
with triumphant fire. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he went on, with a long-drawn guttural
enunciation, taking out his snuff-box, the only luxury he had left himself, and
tapping it with something of his old air of defiance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
from under <i>his</i> thumb now, though I <i>must</i> leave the old mill. I
thought I could ha&rsquo; held out to die here&mdash;but I
can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got a glass o&rsquo; nothing in the house,
have we, Bessy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, drawing out her much-reduced bunch of
keys, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some brandy sister Deane brought me when I was
ill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get it me, then; get it me. I feel a bit weak.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom, my lad,&rdquo; he said, in a stronger voice, when he had taken some
brandy-and-water, &ldquo;you shall make a speech to &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll tell
&rsquo;em it&rsquo;s you as got the best part o&rsquo; the money. They&rsquo;ll
see I&rsquo;m honest at last, and ha&rsquo; got an honest son. Ah! Wakem
&rsquo;ud be fine and glad to have a son like mine,&mdash;a fine straight
fellow,&mdash;i&rsquo;stead o&rsquo; that poor crooked creatur! You&rsquo;ll
prosper i&rsquo; the world, my lad; you&rsquo;ll maybe see the day when Wakem
and his son &rsquo;ull be a round or two below you. You&rsquo;ll like enough be
ta&rsquo;en into partnership, as your uncle Deane was before
you,&mdash;you&rsquo;re in the right way for&rsquo;t; and then there&rsquo;s
nothing to hinder your getting rich. And if ever you&rsquo;re rich
enough&mdash;mind this&mdash;try and get th&rsquo; old mill again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver threw himself back in his chair; his mind, which had so long been
the home of nothing but bitter discontent and foreboding, suddenly filled, by
the magic of joy, with visions of good fortune. But some subtle influence
prevented him from foreseeing the good fortune as happening to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shake hands wi&rsquo; me, my lad,&rdquo; he said, suddenly putting out
his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great thing when a man can be proud as he&rsquo;s
got a good son. I&rsquo;ve had <i>that</i> luck.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom never lived to taste another moment so delicious as that; and Maggie
couldn&rsquo;t help forgetting her own grievances. Tom <i>was</i> good; and in
the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments of true admiration and
gratitude, she felt that the faults he had to pardon in her had never been
redeemed, as his faults were. She felt no jealousy this evening that, for the
first time, she seemed to be thrown into the background in her father&rsquo;s
mind.
</p>

<p>
There was much more talk before bedtime. Mr Tulliver naturally wanted to hear
all the particulars of Tom&rsquo;s trading adventures, and he listened with
growing excitement and delight. He was curious to know what had been said on
every occasion; if possible, what had been thought; and Bob Jakin&rsquo;s part
in the business threw him into peculiar outbursts of sympathy with the
triumphant knowingness of that remarkable packman. Bob&rsquo;s juvenile
history, so far as it had come under Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s knowledge, was
recalled with that sense of astonishing promise it displayed, which is
observable in all reminiscences of the childhood of great men.
</p>

<p>
It was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under the vague
but fierce sense of triumph over Wakem, which would otherwise have been the
channel his joy would have rushed into with dangerous force. Even as it was,
that feeling from time to time gave threats of its ultimate mastery, in sudden
bursts of irrelevant exclamation.
</p>

<p>
It was long before Mr Tulliver got to sleep that night; and the sleep, when it
came, was filled with vivid dreams. At half-past five o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, when Mrs Tulliver was already rising, he alarmed her by starting up
with a sort of smothered shout, and looking round in a bewildered way at the
walls of the bedroom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Mr Tulliver?&rdquo; said his wife. He looked
at her, still with a puzzled expression, and said at last:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;I was dreaming&mdash;did I make a noise?&mdash;I thought
I&rsquo;d got hold of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap39"></a>Chapter VII.<br/>
A Day of Reckoning</h3>

<p>
Mr Tulliver was an essentially sober man,&mdash;able to take his glass and not
averse to it, but never exceeding the bounds of moderation. He had naturally an
active Hotspur temperament, which did not crave liquid fire to set it aglow;
his impetuosity was usually equal to an exciting occasion without any such
reinforcements; and his desire for the brandy-and-water implied that the too
sudden joy had fallen with a dangerous shock on a frame depressed by four years
of gloom and unaccustomed hard fare. But that first doubtful tottering moment
passed, he seemed to gather strength with his gathering excitement; and the
next day, when he was seated at table with his creditors, his eye kindling and
his cheek flushed with the consciousness that he was about to make an
honourable figure once more, he looked more like the proud, confident,
warm-hearted, and warm-tempered Tulliver of old times than might have seemed
possible to any one who had met him a week before, riding along as had been his
wont for the last four years since the sense of failure and debt had been upon
him,&mdash;with his head hanging down, casting brief, unwilling looks on those
who forced themselves on his notice. He made his speech, asserting his honest
principles with his old confident eagerness, alluding to the rascals and the
luck that had been against him, but that he had triumphed over, to some extent,
by hard efforts and the aid of a good son; and winding up with the story of how
Tom had got the best part of the needful money. But the streak of irritation
and hostile triumph seemed to melt for a little while into purer fatherly pride
and pleasure, when, Tom&rsquo;s health having been proposed, and uncle Deane
having taken occasion to say a few words of eulogy on his general character and
conduct, Tom himself got up and made the single speech of his life. It could
hardly have been briefer. He thanked the gentlemen for the honour they had done
him. He was glad that he had been able to help his father in proving his
integrity and regaining his honest name; and, for his own part, he hoped he
should never undo that work and disgrace that name. But the applause that
followed was so great, and Tom looked so gentlemanly as well as tall and
straight, that Mr Tulliver remarked, in an explanatory manner, to his friends
on his right and left, that he had spent a deal of money on his son&rsquo;s
education.
</p>

<p>
The party broke up in very sober fashion at five o&rsquo;clock. Tom remained in
St Ogg&rsquo;s to attend to some business, and Mr Tulliver mounted his horse
to go home, and describe the memorable things that had been said and done, to
&ldquo;poor Bessy and the little wench.&rdquo; The air of excitement that hung
about him was but faintly due to good cheer or any stimulus but the potent wine
of triumphant joy. He did not choose any back street to-day, but rode slowly,
with uplifted head and free glances, along the principal street all the way to
the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Why did he not happen to meet Wakem? The want of that coincidence vexed him,
and set his mind at work in an irritating way. Perhaps Wakem was gone out of
town to-day on purpose to avoid seeing or hearing anything of an honourable
action which might well cause him some unpleasant twinges. If Wakem were to
meet him then, Mr Tulliver would look straight at him, and the rascal would
perhaps be forsaken a little by his cool, domineering impudence. He would know
by and by that an honest man was not going to serve <i>him</i> any longer, and
lend his honesty to fill a pocket already over-full of dishonest gains. Perhaps
the luck was beginning to turn; perhaps the Devil didn&rsquo;t always hold the
best cards in this world.
</p>

<p>
Simmering in this way, Mr Tulliver approached the yardgates of Dorlcote Mill,
near enough to see a well-known figure coming out of them on a fine black
horse. They met about fifty yards from the gates, between the great chestnuts
and elms and the high bank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tulliver,&rdquo; said Wakem, abruptly, in a haughtier tone than usual,
&ldquo;what a fool&rsquo;s trick you did,&mdash;spreading those hard lumps on
that Far Close! I told you how it would be; but you men never learn to farm
with any method.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Tulliver, suddenly boiling up; &ldquo;get somebody else
to farm for you, then, as&rsquo;ll ask <i>you</i> to teach him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have been drinking, I suppose,&rdquo; said Wakem, really believing
that this was the meaning of Tulliver&rsquo;s flushed face and sparkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not been drinking,&rdquo; said Tulliver; &ldquo;I want no
drinking to help me make up my mind as I&rsquo;ll serve no longer under a
scoundrel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well! you may leave my premises to-morrow, then; hold your insolent
tongue and let me pass.&rdquo; (Tulliver was backing his horse across the road
to hem Wakem in.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I <i>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> let you pass,&rdquo; said Tulliver,
getting fiercer. &ldquo;I shall tell you what I think of you first.
You&rsquo;re too big a raskill to get
hanged&mdash;you&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me pass, you ignorant brute, or I&rsquo;ll ride over you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Tulliver, spurring his horse and raising his whip, made a rush forward; and
Wakem&rsquo;s horse, rearing and staggering backward, threw his rider from the
saddle and sent him sideways on the ground. Wakem had had the presence of mind
to loose the bridle at once, and as the horse only staggered a few paces and
then stood still, he might have risen and remounted without more inconvenience
than a bruise and a shake. But before he could rise, Tulliver was off his horse
too. The sight of the long-hated predominant man down, and in his power, threw
him into a frenzy of triumphant vengeance, which seemed to give him
preternatural agility and strength. He rushed on Wakem, who was in the act of
trying to recover his feet, grasped him by the left arm so as to press
Wakem&rsquo;s whole weight on the right arm, which rested on the ground, and
flogged him fiercely across the back with his riding-whip. Wakem shouted for
help, but no help came, until a woman&rsquo;s scream was heard, and the cry of
&ldquo;Father, father!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, Wakem felt, something had arrested Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s arm; for the
flogging ceased, and the grasp on his own arm was relaxed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get away with you&mdash;go!&rdquo; said Tulliver, angrily. But it was
not to Wakem that he spoke. Slowly the lawyer rose, and, as he turned his head,
saw that Tulliver&rsquo;s arms were being held by a girl, rather by the fear of
hurting the girl that clung to him with all her young might.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Luke&mdash;mother&mdash;come and help Mr Wakem!&rdquo; Maggie
cried, as she heard the longed-for footsteps.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Help me on to that low horse,&rdquo; said Wakem to Luke, &ldquo;then I
shall perhaps manage; though&mdash;confound it&mdash;I think this arm is
sprained.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With some difficulty, Wakem was heaved on to Tulliver&rsquo;s horse. Then he
turned toward the miller and said, with white rage, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll suffer
for this, sir. Your daughter is a witness that you&rsquo;ve assaulted
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Mr Tulliver, in a thick, fierce voice;
&ldquo;go and show your back, and tell &rsquo;em I thrashed you. Tell &rsquo;em
I&rsquo;ve made things a bit more even i&rsquo; the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ride my horse home with me,&rdquo; said Wakem to Luke. &ldquo;By the
Tofton Ferry, not through the town.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father, come in!&rdquo; said Maggie, imploringly. Then, seeing that
Wakem had ridden off, and that no further violence was possible, she slackened
her hold and burst into hysteric sobs, while poor Mrs Tulliver stood by in
silence, quivering with fear. But Maggie became conscious that as she was
slackening her hold her father was beginning to grasp her and lean on her. The
surprise checked her sobs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I feel ill&mdash;faintish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Help me in,
Bessy&mdash;I&rsquo;m giddy&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a pain i&rsquo; the head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked in slowly, propped by his wife and daughter and tottered into his
arm-chair. The almost purple flush had given way to paleness, and his hand was
cold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better send for the doctor?&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be too faint and suffering to hear her; but presently, when she
said to Maggie, &ldquo;Go and seek for somebody to fetch the doctor,&rdquo; he
looked up at her with full comprehension, and said, &ldquo;Doctor? No&mdash;no
doctor. It&rsquo;s my head, that&rsquo;s all. Help me to bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sad ending to the day that had risen on them all like a beginning of better
times! But mingled seed must bear a mingled crop.
</p>

<p>
In half an hour after his father had lain down Tom came home. Bob Jakin was
with him, come to congratulate &ldquo;the old master,&rdquo; not without some
excusable pride that he had had his share in bringing about Mr Tom&rsquo;s
good luck; and Tom had thought his father would like nothing better, as a
finish to the day, than a talk with Bob. But now Tom could only spend the
evening in gloomy expectation of the unpleasant consequences that must follow
on this mad outbreak of his father&rsquo;s long-smothered hate. After the
painful news had been told, he sat in silence; he had not spirit or inclination
to tell his mother and sister anything about the dinner; they hardly cared to
ask it. Apparently the mingled thread in the web of their life was so curiously
twisted together that there could be no joy without a sorrow coming close upon
it. Tom was dejected by the thought that his exemplary effort must always be
baffled by the wrong-doing of others; Maggie was living through, over and over
again, the agony of the moment in which she had rushed to throw herself on her
father&rsquo;s arm, with a vague, shuddering foreboding of wretched scenes to
come. Not one of the three felt any particular alarm about Mr Tulliver&rsquo;s
health; the symptoms did not recall his former dangerous attack, and it seemed
only a necessary consequence that his violent passion and effort of strength,
after many hours of unusual excitement, should have made him feel ill. Rest
would probably cure him.
</p>

<p>
Tom, tired out by his active day, fell asleep soon, and slept soundly; it
seemed to him as if he had only just come to bed, when he waked to see his
mother standing by him in the gray light of early morning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My boy, you must get up this minute; I&rsquo;ve sent for the doctor, and
your father wants you and Maggie to come to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he worse, mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been very ill all night with his head, but he doesn&rsquo;t
say it&rsquo;s worse; he only said suddenly, &lsquo;Bessy, fetch the boy and
girl. Tell &rsquo;em to make haste.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie and Tom threw on their clothes hastily in the chill gray light, and
reached their father&rsquo;s room almost at the same moment. He was watching
for them with an expression of pain on his brow, but with sharpened, anxious
consciousness in his eyes. Mrs Tulliver stood at the foot of the bed,
frightened and trembling, looking worn and aged from disturbed rest. Maggie was
at the bedside first, but her father&rsquo;s glance was toward Tom, who came
and stood next to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom, my lad, it&rsquo;s come upon me as I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get up
again. This world&rsquo;s been too many for me, my lad, but you&rsquo;ve done
what you could to make things a bit even. Shake hands wi&rsquo; me again, my
lad, before I go away from you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The father and son clasped hands and looked at each other an instant. Then Tom
said, trying to speak firmly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you any wish, father&mdash;that I can fulfil,
when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, my lad&mdash;you&rsquo;ll try and get the old mill back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s your mother&mdash;you&rsquo;ll try and make her
amends, all you can, for my bad luck&mdash;and there&rsquo;s the little
wench&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The father turned his eyes on Maggie with a still more eager look, while she,
with a bursting heart, sank on her knees, to be closer to the dear, time-worn
face which had been present with her through long years, as the sign of her
deepest love and hardest trial.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must take care of her, Tom&mdash;don&rsquo;t you fret, my
wench&mdash;there&rsquo;ll come somebody as&rsquo;ll love you and take your
part&mdash;and you must be good to her, my lad. I was good to <i>my</i> sister.
Kiss me, Maggie.&mdash;Come, Bessy.&mdash;You&rsquo;ll manage to pay for a
brick grave, Tom, so as your mother and me can lie together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked away from them all when he had said this, and lay silent for some
minutes, while they stood watching him, not daring to move. The morning light
was growing clearer for them, and they could see the heaviness gathering in his
face, and the dulness in his eyes. But at last he looked toward Tom and
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had my turn&mdash;I beat him. That was nothing but fair. I never
wanted anything but what was fair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, father, dear father,&rdquo; said Maggie, an unspeakable anxiety
predominating over her grief, &ldquo;you forgive him&mdash;you forgive every
one now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not move his eyes to look at her, but he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, my wench. I don&rsquo;t forgive him. What&rsquo;s forgiving to do? I
can&rsquo;t love a raskill&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice had become thicker; but he wanted to say more, and moved his lips
again and again, struggling in vain to speak. At length the words forced their
way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does God forgive raskills?&mdash;but if He does, He won&rsquo;t be hard
wi&rsquo; me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His hands moved uneasily, as if he wanted them to remove some obstruction that
weighed upon him. Two or three times there fell from him some broken
words,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This world&rsquo;s&mdash;too many&mdash;honest
man&mdash;puzzling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Soon they merged into mere mutterings; the eyes had ceased to discern; and then
came the final silence.
</p>

<p>
But not of death. For an hour or more the chest heaved, the loud, hard
breathing continued, getting gradually slower, as the cold dews gathered on the
brow.
</p>

<p>
At last there was total stillness, and poor Tulliver&rsquo;s dimly lighted soul
had forever ceased to be vexed with the painful riddle of this world.
</p>

<p>
Help was come now; Luke and his wife were there, and Mr Turnbull had arrived,
too late for everything but to say, &ldquo;This is death.&rdquo;

<p>
Tom and Maggie went downstairs together into the room where their
father&rsquo;s place was empty. Their eyes turned to the same spot, and Maggie
spoke,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom, forgive me&mdash;let us always love each other&rdquo;; and they
clung and wept together.

A Duet in Paradise</h3>

<p>
The well-furnished drawing-room, with the open grand piano, and the pleasant
outlook down a sloping garden to a boat-house by the side of the Floss, is Mr
Deane&rsquo;s. The neat little lady in mourning, whose light-brown ringlets are
falling over the coloured embroidery with which her fingers are busy, is of
course Lucy Deane; and the fine young man who is leaning down from his chair to
snap the scissors in the extremely abbreviated face of the &ldquo;King
Charles&rdquo; lying on the young lady&rsquo;s feet is no other than Mr
Stephen Guest, whose diamond ring, attar of roses, and air of <i>nonchalant</i>
leisure, at twelve o&rsquo;clock in the day, are the graceful and odoriferous
result of the largest oil-mill and the most extensive wharf in St Ogg&rsquo;s.
There is an apparent triviality in the action with the scissors, but your
discernment perceives at once that there is a design in it which makes it
eminently worthy of a large-headed, long-limbed young man; for you see that
Lucy wants the scissors, and is compelled, reluctant as she may be, to shake
her ringlets back, raise her soft hazel eyes, smile playfully down on the face
that is so very nearly on a level with her knee, and holding out her little
shell-pink palm, to say,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My scissors, please, if you can renounce the great pleasure of
persecuting my poor Minny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The foolish scissors have slipped too far over the knuckles, it seems, and
Hercules holds out his entrapped fingers hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Confound the scissors! The oval lies the wrong way. Please draw them off
for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Draw them off with your other hand,&rdquo; says Miss Lucy, roguishly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s my left hand; I&rsquo;m not left-handed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy laughs, and the scissors are drawn off with gentle touches from tiny tips,
which naturally dispose Mr Stephen for a repetition <i>da capo</i>.
Accordingly, he watches for the release of the scissors, that he may get them
into his possession again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lucy, sticking them in her band, &ldquo;you shall
not have my scissors again,&mdash;you have strained them already. Now
don&rsquo;t set Minny growling again. Sit up and behave properly, and then I
will tell you some news.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Stephen, throwing himself back and hanging his
right arm over the corner of his chair. He might have been sitting for his
portrait, which would have represented a rather striking young man of
five-and-twenty, with a square forehead, short dark-brown hair, standing erect,
with a slight wave at the end, like a thick crop of corn, and a half-ardent,
half-sarcastic glance from under his well-marked horizontal eyebrows. &ldquo;Is
it very important news?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very. Guess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are going to change Minny&rsquo;s diet, and give him three ratafias
soaked in a dessert-spoonful of cream daily?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, Dr Kenn has been preaching against buckram, and you ladies
have all been sending him a roundrobin, saying, &lsquo;This is a hard doctrine;
who can bear it?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; said Lucy, adjusting her little mouth gravely.
&ldquo;It is rather dull of you not to guess my news, because it is about
something I mentioned to you not very long ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you have mentioned many things to me not long ago. Does your
feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several
things, I should know it immediately by that mark?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know you think I am silly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you are perfectly charming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And my silliness is part of my charm?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I know you like women to be rather insipid. Philip Wakem betrayed
you; he said so one day when you were not here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know Phil is fierce on that point; he makes it quite a personal
matter. I think he must be love-sick for some unknown lady,&mdash;some exalted
Beatrice whom he met abroad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; said Lucy, pausing in her work, &ldquo;it has just
occurred to me that I never found out whether my cousin Maggie will object to
see Philip, as her brother does. Tom will not enter a room where Philip is, if
he knows it; perhaps Maggie may be the same, and then we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
able to sing our glees, shall we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! is your cousin coming to stay with you?&rdquo; said Stephen, with
a look of slight annoyance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; that was my news, which you have forgotten. She&rsquo;s going to
leave her situation, where she has been nearly two years, poor
thing,&mdash;ever since her father&rsquo;s death; and she will stay with me a
month or two,&mdash;many months, I hope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And am I bound to be pleased at that news?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, not at all,&rdquo; said Lucy, with a little air of pique.
&ldquo;<i>I</i> am pleased, but that, of course, is no reason why <i>you</i>
should be pleased. There is no girl in the world I love so well as my cousin
Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you will be inseparable I suppose, when she comes. There will be no
possibility of a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with you any more, unless you can find an
admirer for her, who will pair off with her occasionally. What is the ground of
dislike to Philip? He might have been a resource.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a family quarrel with Philip&rsquo;s father. There were very
painful circumstances, I believe. I never quite understood them, or knew them
all. My uncle Tulliver was unfortunate and lost all his property, and I think
he considered Mr Wakem was somehow the cause of it. Mr Wakem bought Dorlcote
Mill, my uncle&rsquo;s old place, where he always lived. You must remember my
uncle Tulliver, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Stephen, with rather supercilious indifference.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always known the name, and I dare say I knew the man by
sight, apart from his name. I know half the names and faces in the
neighbourhood in that detached, disjointed way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was a very hot-tempered man. I remember, when I was a little girl and
used to go to see my cousins, he often frightened me by talking as if he were
angry. Papa told me there was a dreadful quarrel, the very day before my
uncle&rsquo;s death, between him and Mr Wakem, but it was hushed up. That was
when you were in London. Papa says my uncle was quite mistaken in many ways;
his mind had become embittered. But Tom and Maggie must naturally feel it very
painful to be reminded of these things. They have had so much, so very much
trouble. Maggie was at school with me six years ago, when she was fetched away
because of her father&rsquo;s misfortunes, and she has hardly had any pleasure
since, I think. She has been in a dreary situation in a school since
uncle&rsquo;s death, because she is determined to be independent, and not live
with aunt Pullet; and I could hardly wish her to come to me then, because dear
mamma was ill, and everything was so sad. That is why I want her to come to me
now, and have a long, long holiday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very sweet and angelic of you,&rdquo; said Stephen, looking at her with
an admiring smile; &ldquo;and all the more so if she has the conversational
qualities of her mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor aunty! You are cruel to ridicule her. She is very valuable to
<i>me</i>, I know. She manages the house beautifully,&mdash;much better than
any stranger would,&mdash;and she was a great comfort to me in mamma&rsquo;s
illness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but in point of companionship one would prefer that she should be
represented by her brandy-cherries and cream-cakes. I think with a shudder that
her daughter will always be present in person, and have no agreeable proxies of
that kind,&mdash;a fat, blond girl, with round blue eyes, who will stare at us
silently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy, laughing wickedly, and clapping her
hands, &ldquo;that is just my cousin Maggie. You must have seen her!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed; I&rsquo;m only guessing what Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s daughter
must be; and then if she is to banish Philip, our only apology for a tenor,
that will be an additional bore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I hope that may not be. I think I will ask you to call on Philip and
tell him Maggie is coming to-morrow. He is quite aware of Tom&rsquo;s feeling,
and always keeps out of his way; so he will understand, if you tell him, that I
asked you to warn him not to come until I write to ask him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you had better write a pretty note for me to take; Phil is so
sensitive, you know, the least thing might frighten him off coming at all, and
we had hard work to get him. I can never induce him to come to the park; he
doesn&rsquo;t like my sisters, I think. It is only your faëry touch that can
lay his ruffled feathers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table, and
touched it lightly with his lips. Little Lucy felt very proud and happy. She
and Stephen were in that stage of courtship which makes the most exquisite
moment of youth, the freshest blossom-time of passion,&mdash;when each is sure
of the other&rsquo;s love, but no formal declaration has been made, and all is
mutual divination, exalting the most trivial word, the lightest gesture, into
thrills delicate and delicious as wafted jasmine scent. The explicitness of an
engagement wears off this finest edge of susceptibility; it is jasmine gathered
and presented in a large bouquet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on
Maggie&rsquo;s appearance and manners,&rdquo; said the cunning Lucy, moving to
reach her desk, &ldquo;because she might have been like her brother, you know;
and Tom has not round eyes; and he is as far as possible from staring at
people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I suppose he is like the father; he seems to be as proud as Lucifer.
Not a brilliant companion, though, I should think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like Tom. He gave me my Minny when I lost Lolo; and papa is very fond
of him: he says Tom has excellent principles. It was through him that his
father was able to pay all his debts before he died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, ah; I&rsquo;ve heard about that. I heard your father and mine
talking about it a little while ago, after dinner, in one of their interminable
discussions about business. They think of doing something for young Tulliver;
he saved them from a considerable loss by riding home in some marvellous way,
like Turpin, to bring them news about the stoppage of a bank, or something of
that sort. But I was rather drowsy at the time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen rose from his seat, and sauntered to the piano, humming in falsetto,
&ldquo;Graceful Consort,&rdquo; as he turned over the volume of &ldquo;The
Creation,&rdquo; which stood open on the desk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and sing this,&rdquo; he said, when he saw Lucy rising.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, &lsquo;Graceful Consort&rsquo;? I don&rsquo;t think it suits your
voice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind; it exactly suits my feeling, which, Philip will have it, is
the grand element of good singing. I notice men with indifferent voices are
usually of that opinion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip burst into one of his invectives against &lsquo;The
Creation&rsquo; the other day,&rdquo; said Lucy, seating herself at the piano.
&ldquo;He says it has a sort of sugared complacency and flattering make-believe
in it, as if it were written for the birthday <i>fête</i> of a German
Grand-Duke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, pooh! He is the fallen Adam with a soured temper. We are Adam and
Eve unfallen, in Paradise. Now, then,&mdash;the recitative, for the sake of the
moral. You will sing the whole duty of woman,&mdash;&lsquo;And from obedience
grows my pride and happiness.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I shall not respect an Adam who drags the <i>tempo</i>, as you
will,&rdquo; said Lucy, beginning to play the duet.
</p>

<p>
Surely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in which
the lovers can sing together. The sense of mutual fitness that springs from the
two deep notes fulfilling expectation just at the right moment between the
notes of the silvery soprano, from the perfect accord of descending thirds and
fifths, from the preconcerted loving chase of a fugue, is likely enough to
supersede any immediate demand for less impassioned forms of agreement. The
contralto will not care to catechise the bass; the tenor will foresee no
embarrassing dearth of remark in evenings spent with the lovely soprano. In the
provinces, too, where music was so scarce in that remote time, how could the
musical people avoid falling in love with each other? Even political principle
must have been in danger of relaxation under such circumstances; and the
violin, faithful to rotten boroughs, must have been tempted to fraternise in a
demoralizing way with a reforming violoncello. In that case, the
linnet-throated soprano and the full-toned bass singing,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;With thee delight is ever new,<br/>
With thee is life incessant bliss,&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
believed what they sang all the more <i>because</i> they sang it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now for Raphael&rsquo;s great song,&rdquo; said Lucy, when they had
finished the duet. &ldquo;You do the &lsquo;heavy beasts&rsquo; to
perfection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That sounds complimentary,&rdquo; said Stephen, looking at his watch.
&ldquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;s nearly half-past one! Well, I can just sing
this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the tread of
the heavy beasts; but when a singer has an audience of two, there is room for
divided sentiments. Minny&rsquo;s mistress was charmed; but Minny, who had
intrenched himself, trembling, in his basket as soon as the music began, found
this thunder so little to his taste that he leaped out and scampered under the
remotest <i>chiffonnier</i>, as the most eligible place in which a small dog
could await the crack of doom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Adieu, &lsquo;graceful consort,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Stephen, buttoning
his coat across when he had done singing, and smiling down from his tall
height, with the air of rather a patronizing lover, at the little lady on the
music-stool. &ldquo;My bliss is not incessant, for I must gallop home. I
promised to be there at lunch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will not be able to call on Philip, then? It is of no consequence; I
have said everything in my note.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be engaged with your cousin to-morrow, I suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we are going to have a little family-party. My cousin Tom will dine
with us; and poor aunty will have her two children together for the first time.
It will be very pretty; I think a great deal about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I may come the next day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes! Come and be introduced to my cousin Maggie; though you can
hardly be said not to have seen her, you have described her so well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, then.&rdquo; And there was that slight pressure of the hands,
and momentary meeting of the eyes, which will often leave a little lady with a
slight flush and smile on her face that do not subside immediately when the
door is closed, and with an inclination to walk up and down the room rather
than to seat herself quietly at her embroidery, or other rational and improving
occupation. At least this was the effect on Lucy; and you will not, I hope,
consider it an indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses,
that she just glanced in the chimney-glass as her walk brought her near it. The
desire to know that one has not looked an absolute fright during a few hours of
conversation may be construed as lying within the bounds of a laudable
benevolent consideration for others. And Lucy had so much of this benevolence
in her nature that I am inclined to think her small egoisms were impregnated
with it, just as there are people not altogether unknown to you whose small
benevolences have a predominant and somewhat rank odor of egoism. Even now,
that she is walking up and down with a little triumphant flutter of her girlish
heart at the sense that she is loved by the person of chief consequence in her
small world, you may see in her hazel eyes an ever-present sunny benignity, in
which the momentary harmless flashes of personal vanity are quite lost; and if
she is happy in thinking of her lover, it is because the thought of him mingles
readily with all the gentle affections and good-natured offices with which she
fills her peaceful days. Even now, her mind, with that instantaneous
alternation which makes two currents of feeling or imagination seem
simultaneous, is glancing continually from Stephen to the preparations she has
only half finished in Maggie&rsquo;s room. Cousin Maggie should be treated as
well as the grandest lady-visitor,&mdash;nay, better, for she should have
Lucy&rsquo;s best prints and drawings in her bedroom, and the very finest
bouquet of spring flowers on her table. Maggie would enjoy all that, she was so
found of pretty things! And there was poor aunt Tulliver, that no one made any
account of, she was to be surprised with the present of a cap of superlative
quality, and to have her health drunk in a gratifying manner, for which Lucy
was going to lay a plot with her father this evening. Clearly, she had not time
to indulge in long reveries about her own happy love-affairs. With this thought
she walked toward the door, but paused there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, then, Minny?&rdquo; she said, stooping in
answer to some whimpering of that small quadruped, and lifting his glossy head
against her pink cheek. &ldquo;Did you think I was going without you? Come,
then, let us go and see Sinbad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sinbad was Lucy&rsquo;s chestnut horse, that she always fed with her own hand
when he was turned out in the paddock. She was fond of feeding dependent
creatures, and knew the private tastes of all the animals about the house,
delighting in the little rippling sounds of her canaries when their beaks were
busy with fresh seed, and in the small nibbling pleasures of certain animals
which, lest she should appear too trivial, I will here call &ldquo;the more
familiar rodents.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Was not Stephen Guest right in his decided opinion that this slim maiden of
eighteen was quite the sort of wife a man would not be likely to repent of
marrying,&mdash;a woman who was loving and thoughtful for other women, not
giving them Judas-kisses with eyes askance on their welcome defects, but with
real care and vision for their half-hidden pains and mortifications, with long
ruminating enjoyment of little pleasures prepared for them? Perhaps the
emphasis of his admiration did not fall precisely on this rarest quality in
her; perhaps he approved his own choice of her chiefly because she did not
strike him as a remarkable rarity. A man likes his wife to be pretty; well,
Lucy was pretty, but not to a maddening extent. A man likes his wife to be
accomplished, gentle, affectionate, and not stupid; and Lucy had all these
qualifications. Stephen was not surprised to find himself in love with her, and
was conscious of excellent judgment in preferring her to Miss Leyburn, the
daughter of the county member, although Lucy was only the daughter of his
father&rsquo;s subordinate partner; besides, he had had to defy and overcome a
slight unwillingness and disappointment in his father and sisters,&mdash;a
circumstance which gives a young man an agreeable consciousness of his own
dignity. Stephen was aware that he had sense and independence enough to choose
the wife who was likely to make him happy, unbiassed by any indirect
considerations. He meant to choose Lucy; she was a little darling, and exactly
the sort of woman he had always admired.

First Impressions</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;He is very clever, Maggie,&rdquo; said Lucy. She was kneeling on a
footstool at Maggie&rsquo;s feet, after placing that dark lady in the large
crimson-velvet chair. &ldquo;I feel sure you will like him. I hope you
will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be very difficult to please,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling, and
holding up one of Lucy&rsquo;s long curls, that the sunlight might shine
through it. &ldquo;A gentleman who thinks he is good enough for Lucy must
expect to be sharply criticised.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, he&rsquo;s a great deal too good for me. And sometimes, when he
is away, I almost think it can&rsquo;t really be that he loves me. But I can
never doubt it when he is with me, though I couldn&rsquo;t bear any one but you
to know that I feel in that way, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, then, if I disapprove of him you can give him up, since you are not
engaged,&rdquo; said Maggie, with playful gravity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would rather not be engaged. When people are engaged, they begin to
think of being married soon,&rdquo; said Lucy, too thoroughly preoccupied to
notice Maggie&rsquo;s joke; &ldquo;and I should like everything to go on for a
long while just as it is. Sometimes I am quite frightened lest Stephen should
say that he has spoken to papa; and from something that fell from papa the
other day, I feel sure he and Mr Guest are expecting that. And Stephen&rsquo;s
sisters are very civil to me now. At first, I think they didn&rsquo;t like his
paying me attention; and that was natural. It <i>does</i> seem out of keeping
that I should ever live in a great place like the Park House, such a little
insignificant thing as I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But people are not expected to be large in proportion to the houses they
live in, like snails,&rdquo; said Maggie, laughing. &ldquo;Pray, are Mr
Guest&rsquo;s sisters giantesses?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no; and not handsome,&mdash;that is, not very,&rdquo; said Lucy,
half-penitent at this uncharitable remark. &ldquo;But <i>he</i> is&mdash;at
least he is generally considered very handsome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Though you are unable to share that opinion?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lucy, blushing pink over brow and
neck. &ldquo;It is a bad plan to raise expectation; you will perhaps be
disappointed. But I have prepared a charming surprise for <i>him;</i> I shall
have a glorious laugh against him. I shall not tell you what it is,
though.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy rose from her knees and went to a little distance, holding her pretty head
on one side, as if she had been arranging Maggie for a portrait, and wished to
judge of the general effect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand up a moment, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is your pleasure now?&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling languidly as she
rose from her chair and looked down on her slight, aerial cousin, whose figure
was quite subordinate to her faultless drapery of silk and crape.
</p>

<p>
Lucy kept her contemplative attitude a moment or two in silence, and then
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what witchery it is in you, Maggie, that makes you
look best in shabby clothes; though you really must have a new dress now. But
do you know, last night I was trying to fancy you in a handsome, fashionable
dress, and do what I would, that old limp merino would come back as the only
right thing for you. I wonder if Marie Antoinette looked all the grander when
her gown was darned at the elbows. Now, if <i>I</i> were to put anything shabby
on, I should be quite unnoticeable. I should be a mere rag.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, quite,&rdquo; said Maggie, with mock gravity. &ldquo;You would be
liable to be swept out of the room with the cobwebs and carpet-dust, and to
find yourself under the grate, like Cinderella. Mayn&rsquo;t I sit down
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, now you may,&rdquo; said Lucy, laughing. Then, with an air of
serious reflection, unfastening her large jet brooch, &ldquo;But you must
change brooches, Maggie; that little butterfly looks silly on you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t that mar the charming effect of my consistent
shabbiness?&rdquo; said Maggie, seating herself submissively, while Lucy knelt
again and unfastened the contemptible butterfly. &ldquo;I wish my mother were
of your opinion, for she was fretting last night because this is my best frock.
I&rsquo;ve been saving my money to pay for some lessons; I shall never get a
better situation without more accomplishments.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie gave a little sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t put on that sad look again,&rdquo; said Lucy, pinning
the large brooch below Maggie&rsquo;s fine throat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
forgetting that you&rsquo;ve left that dreary schoolroom behind you, and have
no little girls&rsquo; clothes to mend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;It is with me as I used to think it
would be with the poor uneasy white bear I saw at the show. I thought he must
have got so stupid with the habit of turning backward and forward in that
narrow space that he would keep doing it if they set him free. One gets a bad
habit of being unhappy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I shall put you under a discipline of pleasure that will make you
lose that bad habit,&rdquo; said Lucy, sticking the black butterfly absently in
her own collar, while her eyes met Maggie&rsquo;s affectionately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You dear, tiny thing,&rdquo; said Maggie, in one of her bursts of loving
admiration, &ldquo;you enjoy other people&rsquo;s happiness so much, I believe
you would do without any of your own. I wish I were like you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been tried in that way,&rdquo; said Lucy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been so happy. I don&rsquo;t know whether I could bear
much trouble; I never had any but poor mamma&rsquo;s death. You <i>have</i>
been tried, Maggie; and I&rsquo;m sure you feel for other people quite as much
as I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Lucy,&rdquo; said Maggie, shaking her head slowly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t enjoy their happiness as you do, else I should be more contented. I
do feel for them when they are in trouble; I don&rsquo;t think I could ever
bear to make any one <i>un</i>happy; and yet I often hate myself, because I get
angry sometimes at the sight of happy people. I think I get worse as I get
older, more selfish. That seems very dreadful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Maggie!&rdquo; said Lucy, in a tone of remonstrance, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe a word of that. It is all a gloomy fancy, just because you
are depressed by a dull, wearisome life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps it is,&rdquo; said Maggie, resolutely clearing away the
clouds from her face with a bright smile, and throwing herself backward in her
chair. &ldquo;Perhaps it comes from the school diet,&mdash;watery rice-pudding
spiced with Pinnock. Let us hope it will give way before my mother&rsquo;s
custards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie took up the &ldquo;Sketch Book,&rdquo; which lay by her on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?&rdquo; said Lucy,
going to survey the effect in the chimney-glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, Mr Guest will be obliged to go out of the room again if he sees
you in it. Pray make haste and put another on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy hurried out of the room, but Maggie did not take the opportunity of
opening her book; she let it fall on her knees, while her eyes wandered to the
window, where she could see the sunshine falling on the rich clumps of spring
flowers and on the long hedge of laurels, and beyond, the silvery breadth of
the dear old Floss, that at this distance seemed to be sleeping in a morning
holiday. The sweet fresh garden-scent came through the open window, and the
birds were busy flitting and alighting, gurgling and singing. Yet
Maggie&rsquo;s eyes began to fill with tears. The sight of the old scenes had
made the rush of memories so painful that even yesterday she had only been able
to rejoice in her mother&rsquo;s restored comfort and Tom&rsquo;s brotherly
friendliness as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance, rather than
in the presence of a happiness which we share. Memory and imagination urged
upon her a sense of privation too keen to let her taste what was offered in the
transient present. Her future, she thought, was likely to be worse than her
past, for after her years of contented renunciation, she had slipped back into
desire and longing; she found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and
harder; she found the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for, and
despaired of, becoming more and more importunate. The sound of the opening door
roused her, and hastily wiping away her tears, she began to turn over the
leaves of her book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is one pleasure, I know, Maggie, that your deepest dismalness will
never resist,&rdquo; said Lucy, beginning to speak as soon as she entered the
room. &ldquo;That is music, and I mean you to have quite a riotous feast of it.
I mean you to get up your playing again, which used to be so much better than
mine, when we were at Laceham.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would have laughed to see me playing the little girls&rsquo; tunes
over and over to them, when I took them to practise,&rdquo; said Maggie,
&ldquo;just for the sake of fingering the dear keys again. But I don&rsquo;t
know whether I could play anything more difficult now than &lsquo;Begone, dull
care!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what a wild state of joy you used to be in when the glee-men came
round,&rdquo; said Lucy, taking up her embroidery; &ldquo;and we might have all
those old glees that you used to love so, if I were certain that you
don&rsquo;t feel exactly as Tom does about some things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought there was nothing you might be more certain
of,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought rather to have said, one particular thing. Because if you feel
just as he does about that, we shall want our third voice. St Ogg&rsquo;s is
so miserably provided with musical gentlemen. There are really only Stephen and
Philip Wakem who have any knowledge of music, so as to be able to sing a
part.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy had looked up from her work as she uttered the last sentence, and saw that
there was a change in Maggie&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does it hurt you to hear the name mentioned, Maggie? If it does, I will
not speak of him again. I know Tom will not see him if he can avoid it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel at all as Tom does on that subject,&rdquo; said
Maggie, rising and going to the window as if she wanted to see more of the
landscape. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always liked Philip Wakem ever since I was a
little girl, and saw him at Lorton. He was so good when Tom hurt his
foot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t
mind his coming sometimes, and we can have much more music than we could
without him. I&rsquo;m very fond of poor Philip, only I wish he were not so
morbid about his deformity. I suppose it <i>is</i> his deformity that makes him
so sad, and sometimes bitter. It is certainly very piteous to see his poor
little crooked body and pale face among great, strong people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Lucy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Maggie, trying to arrest the
prattling stream.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, there is the door-bell. That must be Stephen,&rdquo; Lucy went on,
not noticing Maggie&rsquo;s faint effort to speak. &ldquo;One of the things I
most admire in Stephen is that he makes a greater friend of Philip than any
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was too late for Maggie to speak now; the drawingroom door was opening, and
Minny was already growling in a small way at the entrance of a tall gentleman,
who went up to Lucy and took her hand with a half-polite, half-tender glance
and tone of inquiry, which seemed to indicate that he was unconscious of any
other presence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me introduce you to my cousin, Miss Tulliver,&rdquo; said Lucy,
turning with wicked enjoyment toward Maggie, who now approached from the
farther window. &ldquo;This is Mr Stephen Guest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For one instant Stephen could not conceal his astonishment at the sight of this
tall, dark-eyed nymph with her jet-black coronet of hair; the next, Maggie felt
herself, for the first time in her life, receiving the tribute of a very deep
blush and a very deep bow from a person toward whom she herself was conscious
of timidity.
</p>

<p>
This new experience was very agreeable to her, so agreeable that it almost
effaced her previous emotion about Philip. There was a new brightness in her
eyes, and a very becoming flush on her cheek, as she seated herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before
yesterday,&rdquo; said Lucy, with a pretty laugh of triumph. She enjoyed her
lover&rsquo;s confusion; the advantage was usually on his side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This designing cousin of yours quite deceived me, Miss Tulliver,&rdquo;
said Stephen, seating himself by Lucy, and stooping to play with Minny, only
looking at Maggie furtively. &ldquo;She said you had light hair and blue
eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, it was you who said so,&rdquo; remonstrated Lucy. &ldquo;I only
refrained from destroying your confidence in your own second-sight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could always err in the same way,&rdquo; said Stephen,
&ldquo;and find reality so much more beautiful than my preconceptions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you have proved yourself equal to the occasion,&rdquo; said Maggie,
&ldquo;and said what it was incumbent on you to say under the
circumstances.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She flashed a slightly defiant look at him; it was clear to her that he had
been drawing a satirical portrait of her beforehand. Lucy had said he was
inclined to be satirical, and Maggie had mentally supplied the addition,
&ldquo;and rather conceited.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An alarming amount of devil there,&rdquo; was Stephen&rsquo;s first
thought. The second, when she had bent over her work, was, &ldquo;I wish she
would look at me again.&rdquo; The next was to answer,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true. A
man is occasionally grateful when he says &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s
rather hard upon him that he must use the same words with which all the world
declines a disagreeable invitation, don&rsquo;t you think so, Miss
Tulliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie, looking at him with her direct glance; &ldquo;if
we use common words on a great occasion, they are the more striking, because
they are felt at once to have a particular meaning, like old banners, or
everyday clothes, hung up in a sacred place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then my compliment ought to be eloquent,&rdquo; said Stephen, really not
quite knowing what he said while Maggie looked at him, &ldquo;seeing that the
words were so far beneath the occasion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of
indifference,&rdquo; said Maggie, flushing a little.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was rather alarmed; she thought Stephen and Maggie were not going to like
each other. She had always feared lest Maggie should appear too old and clever
to please that critical gentleman. &ldquo;Why, dear Maggie,&rdquo; she
interposed, &ldquo;you have always pretended that you are too fond of being
admired; and now, I think, you are angry because some one ventures to admire
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Maggie; &ldquo;I like too well to feel that I am
admired, but compliments never make me feel that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will never pay you a compliment again, Miss Tulliver,&rdquo; said
Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you; that will be a proof of respect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor Maggie! She was so unused to society that she could take nothing as a
matter of course, and had never in her life spoken from the lips merely, so
that she must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced ladies, from the
excessive feeling she was apt to throw into very trivial incidents. But she was
even conscious herself of a little absurdity in this instance. It was true she
had a theoretic objection to compliments, and had once said impatiently to
Philip that she didn&rsquo;t see why women were to be told with a simper that
they were beautiful, any more than old men were to be told that they were
venerable; still, to be so irritated by a common practice in the case of a
stranger like Mr Stephen Guest, and to care about his having spoken
slightingly of her before he had seen her, was certainly unreasonable, and as
soon as she was silent she began to be ashamed of herself. It did not occur to
her that her irritation was due to the pleasanter emotion which preceded it,
just as when we are satisfied with a sense of glowing warmth an innocent drop
of cold water may fall upon us as a sudden smart.
</p>

<p>
Stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous conversation
could have been felt embarrassing, and at once began to talk of impersonal
matters, asking Lucy if she knew when the bazaar was at length to take place,
so that there might be some hope of seeing her rain the influence of her eyes
on objects more grateful than those worsted flowers that were growing under her
fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some day next month, I believe,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;But your
sisters are doing more for it than I am; they are to have the largest
stall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah yes; but they carry on their manufactures in their own sitting-room,
where I don&rsquo;t intrude on them. I see you are not addicted to the
fashionable vice of fancy-work, Miss Tulliver,&rdquo; said Stephen, looking at
Maggie&rsquo;s plain hemming.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;I can do nothing more difficult or more
elegant than shirt-making.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your plain sewing is so beautiful, Maggie,&rdquo; said Lucy,
&ldquo;that I think I shall beg a few specimens of you to show as fancy-work.
Your exquisite sewing is quite a mystery to me, you used to dislike that sort
of work so much in old days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a mystery easily explained, dear,&rdquo; said Maggie, looking up
quietly. &ldquo;Plain sewing was the only thing I could get money by, so I was
obliged to try and do it well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy, good and simple as she was, could not help blushing a little. She did not
quite like that Stephen should know that; Maggie need not have mentioned it.
Perhaps there was some pride in the confession,&mdash;the pride of poverty that
will not be ashamed of itself. But if Maggie had been the queen of coquettes
she could hardly have invented a means of giving greater piquancy to her beauty
in Stephen&rsquo;s eyes; I am not sure that the quiet admission of plain sewing
and poverty would have done alone, but assisted by the beauty, they made Maggie
more unlike other women even than she had seemed at first.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I can knit, Lucy,&rdquo; Maggie went on, &ldquo;if that will be of
any use for your bazaar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, of infinite use. I shall set you to work with scarlet wool
to-morrow. But your sister is the most enviable person,&rdquo; continued Lucy,
turning to Stephen, &ldquo;to have the talent of modelling. She is doing a
wonderful bust of Dr Kenn entirely from memory.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, if she can remember to put the eyes very near together, and the
corners of the mouth very far apart, the likeness can hardly fail to be
striking in St Ogg&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now that is very wicked of you,&rdquo; said Lucy, looking rather hurt.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would speak disrespectfully of Dr Kenn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say anything disrespectful of Dr Kenn? Heaven forbid! But I am not
bound to respect a libellous bust of him. I think Kenn one of the finest
fellows in the world. I don&rsquo;t care much about the tall candlesticks he
has put on the communion-table, and I shouldn&rsquo;t like to spoil my temper
by getting up to early prayers every morning. But he&rsquo;s the only man I
ever knew personally who seems to me to have anything of the real apostle in
him,&mdash;a man who has eight hundred a-year and is contented with deal
furniture and boiled beef because he gives away two-thirds of his income. That
was a very fine thing of him,&mdash;taking into his house that poor lad
Grattan, who shot his mother by accident. He sacrifices more time than a less
busy man could spare, to save the poor fellow from getting into a morbid state
of mind about it. He takes the lad out with him constantly, I see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is beautiful,&rdquo; said Maggie, who had let her work fall, and
was listening with keen interest. &ldquo;I never knew any one who did such
things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And one admires that sort of action in Kenn all the more,&rdquo; said
Stephen, &ldquo;because his manners in general are rather cold and severe.
There&rsquo;s nothing sugary and maudlin about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I think he&rsquo;s a perfect character!&rdquo; said Lucy, with
pretty enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; there I can&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; said Stephen, shaking his
head with sarcastic gravity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, what fault can you point out in him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Anglican.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, those are the right views, I think,&rdquo; said Lucy, gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That settles the question in the abstract,&rdquo; said Stephen,
&ldquo;but not from a parliamentary point of view. He has set the Dissenters
and the Church people by the ears; and a rising senator like myself, of whose
services the country is very much in need, will find it inconvenient when he
puts up for the honour of representing St Ogg&rsquo;s in Parliament.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you really think of that?&rdquo; said Lucy, her eyes brightening with
a proud pleasure that made her neglect the argumentative interests of
Anglicanism.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Decidedly, whenever old Mr Leyburn&rsquo;s public spirit and gout
induce him to give way. My father&rsquo;s heart is set on it; and gifts like
mine, you know&rdquo;&mdash;here Stephen drew himself up, and rubbed his large
white hands over his hair with playful self-admiration&mdash;&ldquo;gifts like
mine involve great responsibilities. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Miss
Tulliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling, but not looking up; &ldquo;so much
fluency and self-possession should not be wasted entirely on private
occasions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I see how much penetration you have,&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;You
have discovered already that I am talkative and impudent. Now superficial
people never discern that, owing to my manner, I suppose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look at me when I talk of myself,&rdquo; he thought,
while his listeners were laughing. &ldquo;I must try other subjects.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Did Lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the Book Club next week? was
the next question. Then followed the recommendation to choose Southey&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Life of Cowper,&rdquo; unless she were inclined to be philosophical, and
startle the ladies of St Ogg&rsquo;s by voting for one of the Bridgewater
Treatises. Of course Lucy wished to know what these alarmingly learned books
were; and as it is always pleasant to improve the minds of ladies by talking to
them at ease on subjects of which they know nothing, Stephen became quite
brilliant in an account of Buckland&rsquo;s Treatise, which he had just been
reading. He was rewarded by seeing Maggie let her work fall, and gradually get
so absorbed in his wonderful geological story that she sat looking at him,
leaning forward with crossed arms, and with an entire absence of
self-consciousness, as if he had been the snuffiest of old professors, and she
a downy-lipped alumna. He was so fascinated by the clear, large gaze that at
last he forgot to look away from it occasionally toward Lucy; but she, sweet
child, was only rejoicing that Stephen was proving to Maggie how clever he was,
and that they would certainly be good friends after all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will bring you the book, shall I, Miss Tulliver?&rdquo; said Stephen,
when he found the stream of his recollections running rather shallow.
&ldquo;There are many illustrations in it that you will like to see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; said Maggie, blushing with returning
self-consciousness at this direct address, and taking up her work again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Lucy interposed. &ldquo;I must forbid your plunging
Maggie in books. I shall never get her away from them; and I want her to have
delicious do-nothing days, filled with boating and chatting and riding and
driving; that is the holiday she needs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Apropos!&rdquo; said Stephen, looking at his watch. &ldquo;Shall we go
out for a row on the river now? The tide will suit for us to the Tofton way,
and we can walk back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was a delightful proposition to Maggie, for it was years since she had
been on the river. When she was gone to put on her bonnet, Lucy lingered to
give an order to the servant, and took the opportunity of telling Stephen that
Maggie had no objection to seeing Philip, so that it was a pity she had sent
that note the day before yesterday. But she would write another to-morrow and
invite him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call and beat him up to-morrow,&rdquo; said Stephen,
&ldquo;and bring him with me in the evening, shall I? My sisters will want to
call on you when I tell them your cousin is with you. I must leave the field
clear for them in the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, pray bring him,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;And you <i>will</i>
like Maggie, sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she added, in a beseeching tone.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a dear, noble-looking creature?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too tall,&rdquo; said Stephen, smiling down upon her, &ldquo;and a
little too fiery. She is not my type of woman, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gentlemen, you are aware, are apt to impart these imprudent confidences to
ladies concerning their unfavourable opinion of sister fair ones. That is why
so many women have the advantage of knowing that they are secretly repulsive to
men who have self-denyingly made ardent love to them. And hardly anything could
be more distinctively characteristic of Lucy than that she both implicitly
believed what Stephen said, and was determined that Maggie should not know it.
But you, who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you, have already
foreseen, as the direct sequence to that unfavourable opinion of
Stephen&rsquo;s, that he walked down to the boathouse calculating, by the aid
of a vivid imagination, that Maggie must give him her hand at least twice in
consequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a gentleman who wishes
ladies to look at him is advantageously situated when he is rowing them in a
boat. What then? Had he fallen in love with this surprising daughter of Mrs
Tulliver at first sight? Certainly not. Such passions are never heard of in
real life. Besides, he was in love already, and half-engaged to the dearest
little creature in the world; and he was not a man to make a fool of himself in
any way. But when one is five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones at
one&rsquo;s finger-ends that the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely
indifferent. It was perfectly natural and safe to admire beauty and enjoy
looking at it,&mdash;at least under such circumstances as the present. And
there was really something very interesting about this girl, with her poverty
and troubles; it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two cousins.
Generally, Stephen admitted, he was not fond of women who had any peculiarity
of character, but here the peculiarity seemed really of a superior kind, and
provided one is not obliged to marry such women, why, they certainly make a
variety in social intercourse.
</p>

<p>
Maggie did not fulfil Stephen&rsquo;s hope by looking at him during the first
quarter of an hour; her eyes were too full of the old banks that she knew so
well. She felt lonely, cut off from Philip,&mdash;the only person who had ever
seemed to love her devotedly, as she had always longed to be loved. But
presently the rhythmic movement of the oars attracted her, and she thought she
should like to learn how to row. This roused her from her reverie, and she
asked if she might take an oar. It appeared that she required much teaching,
and she became ambitious. The exercise brought the warm blood into her cheeks,
and made her inclined to take her lesson merrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall not be satisfied until I can manage both oars, and row you and
Lucy,&rdquo; she said, looking very bright as she stepped out of the boat.
Maggie, we know, was apt to forget the thing she was doing, and she had chosen
an inopportune moment for her remark; her foot slipped, but happily Mr Stephen
Guest held her hand, and kept her up with a firm grasp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have not hurt yourself at all, I hope?&rdquo; he said, bending to
look in her face with anxiety. It was very charming to be taken care of in that
kind, graceful manner by some one taller and stronger than one&rsquo;s self.
Maggie had never felt just in the same way before.
</p>

<p>
When they reached home again, they found uncle and aunt Pullet seated with Mrs
Tulliver in the drawing-room, and Stephen hurried away, asking leave to come
again in the evening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away,&rdquo;
said Lucy. &ldquo;I want Maggie to hear your best songs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Aunt Pullet, under the certainty that Maggie would be invited to go out with
Lucy, probably to Park House, was much shocked at the shabbiness of her
clothes, which when witnessed by the higher society of St Ogg&rsquo;s, would
be a discredit to the family, that demanded a strong and prompt remedy; and the
consultation as to what would be most suitable to this end from among the
superfluities of Mrs Pullet&rsquo;s wardrobe was one that Lucy as well as Mrs
Tulliver entered into with some zeal. Maggie must really have an evening dress
as soon as possible, and she was about the same height as aunt Pullet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s so much broader across the shoulders than I am,
it&rsquo;s very ill-convenient,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, &ldquo;else she might
wear that beautiful black brocade o&rsquo; mine without any alteration; and her
arms are beyond everything,&rdquo; added Mrs Pullet, sorrowfully, as she
lifted Maggie&rsquo;s large round arm, &ldquo;She&rsquo;d never get my sleeves
on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, never mind that, aunt; send us the dress,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean Maggie to have long sleeves, and I have abundance of black
lace for trimming. Her arms will look beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie&rsquo;s arms <i>are</i> a pretty shape,&rdquo; said Mrs
Tulliver. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re like mine used to be, only mine was never brown;
I wish she&rsquo;d had <i>our</i> family skin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, aunty!&rdquo; said Lucy, patting her aunt Tulliver&rsquo;s
shoulder, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand those things. A painter would think
Maggie&rsquo;s complexion beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, submissively. &ldquo;You know
better than I do. Only when I was young a brown skin wasn&rsquo;t thought well
on among respectable folks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said uncle Pullet, who took intense interest in the
ladies&rsquo; conversation as he sucked his lozenges. &ldquo;Though there was a
song about the &lsquo;Nut-brown Maid&rsquo; too; I think she was
crazy,&mdash;crazy Kate,&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t justly remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, dear!&rdquo; said Maggie, laughing, but impatient; &ldquo;I
think that will be the end of <i>my</i> brown skin, if it is always to be
talked about so much.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap42"></a>Chapter III.<br/>
Confidential Moments</h3>

<p>
When Maggie went up to her bedroom that night, it appeared that she was not at
all inclined to undress. She set down her candle on the first table that
presented itself, and began to walk up and down her room, which was a large
one, with a firm, regular, and rather rapid step, which showed that the
exercise was the instinctive vent of strong excitement. Her eyes and cheeks had
an almost feverish brilliancy; her head was thrown backward, and her hands were
clasped with the palms outward, and with that tension of the arms which is apt
to accompany mental absorption.
</p>

<p>
Had anything remarkable happened?
</p>

<p>
Nothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree unimportant.
She had been hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass voice,&mdash;but then
it was sung in a provincial, amateur fashion, such as would have left a
critical ear much to desire. And she was conscious of having been looked at a
great deal, in rather a furtive manner, from beneath a pair of well-marked
horizontal eyebrows, with a glance that seemed somehow to have caught the
vibratory influence of the voice. Such things could have had no perceptible
effect on a thoroughly well-educated young lady, with a perfectly balanced
mind, who had had all the advantages of fortune, training, and refined society.
But if Maggie had been that young lady, you would probably have known nothing
about her: her life would have had so few vicissitudes that it could hardly
have been written; for the happiest women, like the happiest nations, have no
history.
</p>

<p>
In poor Maggie&rsquo;s highly-strung, hungry nature,&mdash;just come away from
a third-rate schoolroom, with all its jarring sounds and petty round of
tasks,&mdash;these apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and
exalting her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself. It was not
that she thought distinctly of Mr Stephen Guest, or dwelt on the indications
that he looked at her with admiration; it was rather that she felt the
half-remote presence of a world of love and beauty and delight, made up of
vague, mingled images from all the poetry and romance she had ever read, or had
ever woven in her dreamy reveries. Her mind glanced back once or twice to the
time when she had courted privation, when she had thought all longing, all
impatience was subdued; but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone, and she
recoiled from the remembrance of it. No prayer, no striving now, would bring
back that negative peace; the battle of her life, it seemed, was not to be
decided in that short and easy way,&mdash;by perfect renunciation at the very
threshold of her youth.
</p>

<p>
The music was vibrating in her still,&mdash;Purcell&rsquo;s music, with its
wild passion and fancy,&mdash;and she could not stay in the recollection of
that bare, lonely past. She was in her brighter aerial world again, when a
little tap came at the door; of course it was her cousin, who entered in ample
white dressing-gown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Maggie, you naughty child, haven&rsquo;t you begun to
undress?&rdquo; said Lucy, in astonishment. &ldquo;I promised not to come and
talk to you, because I thought you must be tired. But here you are, looking as
if you were ready to dress for a ball. Come, come, get on your dressing-gown
and unplait your hair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> are not very forward,&rdquo; retorted Maggie, hastily
reaching her own pink cotton gown, and looking at Lucy&rsquo;s light-brown hair
brushed back in curly disorder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have not much to do. I shall sit down and talk to you till I see
you are really on the way to bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While Maggie stood and unplaited her long black hair over her pink drapery,
Lucy sat down near the toilette-table, watching her with affectionate eyes, and
head a little aside, like a pretty spaniel. If it appears to you at all
incredible that young ladies should be led on to talk confidentially in a
situation of this kind, I will beg you to remember that human life furnishes
many exceptional cases.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You really <i>have</i> enjoyed the music to-night, haven&rsquo;t you
Maggie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, that is what prevented me from feeling sleepy. I think I should
have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music. It seems to
infuse strength into my limbs, and ideas into my brain. Life seems to go on
without effort, when I am filled with music. At other times one is conscious of
carrying a weight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Stephen has a splendid voice, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps we are neither of us judges of that,&rdquo; said Maggie,
laughing, as she seated herself and tossed her long hair back. &ldquo;You are
not impartial, and <i>I</i> think any barrel-organ splendid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But tell me what you think of him, now. Tell me exactly; good and bad
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I think you should humiliate him a little. A lover should not be so
much at ease, and so self-confident. He ought to tremble more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Maggie! As if any one could tremble at me! You think he is
conceited, I see that. But you don&rsquo;t dislike him, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dislike him! No. Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people, that
I should be very difficult to please? Besides, how could I dislike any one that
promised to make you happy, my dear thing!&rdquo; Maggie pinched Lucy&rsquo;s
dimpled chin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall have more music to-morrow evening,&rdquo; said Lucy, looking
happy already, &ldquo;for Stephen will bring Philip Wakem with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lucy, I can&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; said Maggie, turning pale.
&ldquo;At least, I could not see him without Tom&rsquo;s leave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Tom such a tyrant as that?&rdquo; said Lucy, surprised.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility, then,&mdash;tell him it was my
fault.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, dear,&rdquo; said Maggie, falteringly, &ldquo;I promised Tom very
solemnly, before my father&rsquo;s death,&mdash;I promised him I would not
speak to Philip without his knowledge and consent. And I have a great dread of
opening the subject with Tom,&mdash;of getting into a quarrel with him
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable. What harm can
poor Philip have done? May I speak to Tom about it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, pray don&rsquo;t, dear,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
to him myself to-morrow, and tell him that you wish Philip to come. I&rsquo;ve
thought before of asking him to absolve me from my promise, but I&rsquo;ve not
had the courage to determine on it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were both silent for some moments, and then Lucy said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie, you have secrets from me, and I have none from you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie looked meditatively away from Lucy. Then she turned to her and said,
&ldquo;I <i>should</i> like to tell you about Philip. But, Lucy, you must not
betray that you know it to any one&mdash;least of all to Philip himself, or to
Mr Stephen Guest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The narrative lasted long, for Maggie had never before known the relief of such
an outpouring; she had never before told Lucy anything of her inmost life; and
the sweet face bent toward her with sympathetic interest, and the little hand
pressing hers, encouraged her to speak on. On two points only she was not
expansive. She did not betray fully what still rankled in her mind as
Tom&rsquo;s great offence,&mdash;the insults he had heaped on Philip. Angry as
the remembrance still made her, she could not bear that any one else should
know it at all, both for Tom&rsquo;s sake and Philip&rsquo;s. And she could not
bear to tell Lucy of the last scene between her father and Wakem, though it was
this scene which she had ever since felt to be a new barrier between herself
and Philip. She merely said, she saw now that Tom was, no the whole, right in
regarding any prospect of love and marriage between her and Philip as put out
of the question by the relation of the two families. Of course Philip&rsquo;s
father would never consent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, Lucy, you have had my story,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling, with
the tears in her eyes. &ldquo;You see I am like Sir Andrew Aguecheek. <i>I</i>
was adored once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything, and have
learned so much since you left school; which always seemed to me witchcraft
before,&mdash;part of your general uncanniness,&rdquo; said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
She mused a little with her eyes downward, and then added, looking at Maggie,
&ldquo;It is very beautiful that you should love Philip; I never thought such a
happiness would befall him. And in my opinion, you ought not to give him up.
There are obstacles now; but they may be done away with in time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; persisted Lucy; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help being hopeful
about it. There is something romantic in it,&mdash;out of the common
way,&mdash;just what everything that happens to you ought to be. And Philip
will adore you like a husband in a fairy tale. Oh, I shall puzzle my small
brain to contrive some plot that will bring everybody into the right mind, so
that you may marry Philip when I marry&mdash;somebody else. Wouldn&rsquo;t that
be a pretty ending to all my poor, poor Maggie&rsquo;s troubles?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie tried to smile, but shivered, as if she felt a sudden chill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, dear, you are cold,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;You must go to bed; and
so must I. I dare not think what time it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They kissed each other, and Lucy went away, possessed of a confidence which had
a strong influence over her subsequent impressions. Maggie had been thoroughly
sincere; her nature had never found it easy to be otherwise. But confidences
are sometimes blinding, even when they are sincere.

<h3><a name="chap43"></a>Chapter IV.<br/>
Brother and Sister</h3>

<p>
Maggie was obliged to go to Tom&rsquo;s lodgings in the middle of the day, when
he would be coming in to dinner, else she would not have found him at home. He
was not lodging with entire strangers. Our friend Bob Jakin had, with
Mumps&rsquo;s tacit consent, taken not only a wife about eight months ago, but
also one of those queer old houses, pierced with surprising passages, by the
water-side, where, as he observed, his wife and mother could keep themselves
out of mischief by letting out two &ldquo;pleasure-boats,&rdquo; in which he
had invested some of his savings, and by taking in a lodger for the parlour and
spare bedroom. Under these circumstances, what could be better for the
interests of all parties, sanitary considerations apart, than that the lodger
should be Mr Tom?
</p>

<p>
It was Bob&rsquo;s wife who opened the door to Maggie. She was a tiny woman,
with the general physiognomy of a Dutch doll, looking, in comparison with
Bob&rsquo;s mother, who filled up the passage in the rear, very much like one
of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently standing near a
colossal statue to show the proportions. The tiny woman curtsied and looked up
at Maggie with some awe as soon as she had opened the door; but the words,
&ldquo;Is my brother at home?&rdquo; which Maggie uttered smilingly, made her
turn round with sudden excitement, and say,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, mother, mother&mdash;tell Bob!&mdash;it&rsquo;s Miss Maggie! Come
in, Miss, for goodness do,&rdquo; she went on, opening a side door, and
endeavoring to flatten her person against the wall to make the utmost space for
the visitor.
</p>

<p>
Sad recollections crowded on Maggie as she entered the small parlour, which was
now all that poor Tom had to call by the name of &ldquo;home,&rdquo;&mdash;that
name which had once, so many years ago, meant for both of them the same sum of
dear familiar objects. But everything was not strange to her in this new room;
the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old Bible, and the sight was
not likely to disperse the old memories. She stood without speaking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you please to take the privilege o&rsquo; sitting down, Miss,&rdquo;
said Mrs Jakin, rubbing her apron over a perfectly clean chair, and then
lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it to her face with an air of
embarrassment, as she looked wonderingly at Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bob is at home, then?&rdquo; said Maggie, recovering herself, and
smiling at the bashful Dutch doll.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Miss; but I think he must be washing and dressing himself;
I&rsquo;ll go and see,&rdquo; said Mrs Jakin, disappearing.
</p>

<p>
But she presently came back walking with new courage a little way behind her
husband, who showed the brilliancy of his blue eyes and regular white teeth in
the doorway, bowing respectfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, Bob?&rdquo; said Maggie, coming forward and putting out
her hand to him; &ldquo;I always meant to pay your wife a visit, and I shall
come another day on purpose for that, if she will let me. But I was obliged to
come to-day to speak to my brother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be in before long, Miss. He&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; finely, Mr
Tom is; he&rsquo;ll be one o&rsquo; the first men
hereabouts,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bob, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be indebted to you, whatever he
becomes; he said so himself only the other night, when he was talking of
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Miss, that&rsquo;s his way o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; it. But I think the
more on&rsquo;t when he says a thing, because his tongue doesn&rsquo;t
overshoot him as mine does. Lors! I&rsquo;m no better nor a tilted bottle, I
ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stop mysen when once I begin. But you
look rarely, Miss; it does me good to see you. What do you say now,
Prissy?&rdquo;&mdash;here Bob turned to his wife,&mdash;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
all come true as I said? Though there isn&rsquo;t many sorts o&rsquo; goods as
I can&rsquo;t over-praise when I set my tongue to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bob&rsquo;s small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in
turning up reverentially toward Maggie, but she was able now to smile and
curtsey, and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d looked forrard like aenything to
seein&rsquo; you, Miss, for my husband&rsquo;s tongue&rsquo;s been
runnin&rsquo; on you, like as if he was light-headed, iver since first he come
a-courtin&rsquo; on me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Bob, looking rather silly. &ldquo;Go an&rsquo;
see after the taters, else Mr Tom &rsquo;ull have to wait for
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope Mumps is friendly with Mrs Jakin, Bob,&rdquo; said Maggie,
smiling. &ldquo;I remember you used to say he wouldn&rsquo;t like your
marrying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;he made up his mind to&rsquo;t when he
see&rsquo;d what a little un she was. He pretends not to see her mostly, or
else to think as she isn&rsquo;t full-growed. But about Mr Tom, Miss,&rdquo;
said Bob, speaking lower and looking serious, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s as close as a
iron biler, he is; but I&rsquo;m a &rsquo;cutish chap, an&rsquo; when
I&rsquo;ve left off carrying my pack, an&rsquo; am at a loose end, I&rsquo;ve
got more brains nor I know what to do wi&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m forced to
busy myself wi&rsquo; other folks&rsquo;s insides. An&rsquo; it worrets me as
Mr Tom&rsquo;ll sit by himself so glumpish, a-knittin&rsquo; his brow,
an&rsquo; a-lookin&rsquo; at the fire of a night. He should be a bit livelier
now, a fine young fellow like him. My wife says, when she goes in sometimes,
an&rsquo; he takes no notice of her, he sits lookin&rsquo; into the fire, and
frownin&rsquo; as if he was watchin&rsquo; folks at work in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He thinks so much about business,&rdquo; said Maggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Bob, speaking lower; &ldquo;but do you think it&rsquo;s
nothin&rsquo; else, Miss? He&rsquo;s close, Mr Tom is; but I&rsquo;m a
&rsquo;cute chap, I am, an&rsquo; I thought tow&rsquo;rt last Christmas as
I&rsquo;d found out a soft place in him. It was about a little black
spaniel&mdash;a rare bit o&rsquo; breed&mdash;as he made a fuss to get. But
since then summat&rsquo;s come over him, as he&rsquo;s set his teeth
again&rsquo; things more nor iver, for all he&rsquo;s had such good luck.
An&rsquo; I wanted to tell <i>you</i>, Miss, &rsquo;cause I thought you might
work it out of him a bit, now you&rsquo;re come. He&rsquo;s a deal too lonely,
and doesn&rsquo;t go into company enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have very little power over him, Bob,&rdquo; said
Maggie, a good deal moved by Bob&rsquo;s suggestion. It was a totally new idea
to her mind that Tom could have his love troubles. Poor fellow!&mdash;and in
love with Lucy too! But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob&rsquo;s too
officious brain. The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and
gratitude. But Bob had already said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr Tom,&rdquo; and
the outer door was opening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no time to spare, Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, as soon as Bob left
the room. &ldquo;I must tell you at once what I came about, else I shall be
hindering you from taking your dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom stood with his back against the chimney-piece, and Maggie was seated
opposite the light. He noticed that she was tremulous, and he had a
presentiment of the subject she was going to speak about. The presentiment made
his voice colder and harder as he said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie, and she put her request in
quite a different form from the one she had predetermined on. She rose from her
seat, and looking straight at Tom, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem. Or rather,
I promised you not to see him without telling you. I am come to tell you that I
wish to see him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Tom, still more coldly.
</p>

<p>
But Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill, defiant manner, before
she repented, and felt the dread of alienation from her brother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not for myself, dear Tom. Don&rsquo;t be angry. I shouldn&rsquo;t have
asked it, only that Philip, you know, is a friend of Lucy&rsquo;s and she
wishes him to come, has invited him to come this evening; and I told her I
couldn&rsquo;t see him without telling you. I shall only see him in the
presence of other people. There will never be anything secret between us
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom looked away from Maggie, knitting his brow more strongly for a little
while. Then he turned to her and said, slowly and emphatically,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know what is my feeling on that subject, Maggie. There is no need
for my repeating anything I said a year ago. While my father was living, I felt
bound to use the utmost power over you, to prevent you from disgracing him as
well as yourself, and all of us. But now I must leave you to your own choice.
You wish to be independent; you told me so after my father&rsquo;s death. My
opinion is not changed. If you think of Philip Wakem as a lover again, you must
give up me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish it, dear Tom, at least as things are; I see that it
would lead to misery. But I shall soon go away to another situation, and I
should like to be friends with him again while I am here. Lucy wishes
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The severity of Tom&rsquo;s face relaxed a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind your seeing him occasionally at my
uncle&rsquo;s&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want you to make a fuss on the subject. But I
have no confidence in you, Maggie. You would be led away to do anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was a cruel word. Maggie&rsquo;s lip began to tremble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why will you say that, Tom? It is very hard of you. Have I not done and
borne everything as well as I could? And I kept my word to
you&mdash;when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash;My life has not been a happy one, any
more than yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was obliged to be childish; the tears would come. When Maggie was not
angry, she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sunshine or
the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue her, as, in old days, it
subdued her in the worm-eaten attic. The brother&rsquo;s goodness came
uppermost at this appeal, but it could only show itself in Tom&rsquo;s fashion.
He put his hand gently on her arm, and said, in the tone of a kind
pedagogue,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now listen to me, Maggie. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean. You&rsquo;re
always in extremes; you have no judgment and self-command; and yet you think
you know best, and will not submit to be guided. You know I didn&rsquo;t wish
you to take a situation. My aunt Pullet was willing to give you a good home,
and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations, until I could have
provided a home for you with my mother. And that is what I should like to do. I
wished my sister to be a lady, and I always have taken care of you, as my
father desired, until you were well married. But your ideas and mine never
accord, and you will not give way. Yet you might have sense enough to see that
a brother, who goes out into the world and mixes with men, necessarily knows
better what is right and respectable for his sister than she can know herself.
You think I am not kind; but my kindness can only be directed by what I believe
to be good for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know, dear Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, still half-sobbing, but
trying to control her tears. &ldquo;I know you would do a great deal for me; I
know how you work, and don&rsquo;t spare yourself. I am grateful to you. But,
indeed, you can&rsquo;t quite judge for me; our natures are very different. You
don&rsquo;t know how differently things affect me from what they do you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I <i>do</i> know; I know it too well. I know how differently you
must feel about all that affects our family, and your own dignity as a young
woman, before you could think of receiving secret addresses from Philip Wakem.
If it was not disgusting to me in every other way, I should object to my
sister&rsquo;s name being associated for a moment with that of a young man
whose father must hate the very thought of us all, and would spurn you. With
any one but you, I should think it quite certain that what you witnessed just
before my father&rsquo;s death would secure you from ever thinking again of
Philip Wakem as a lover. But I don&rsquo;t feel certain of it with you; I never
feel certain about anything with <i>you</i>. At one time you take pleasure in a
sort of perverse self-denial, and at another you have not resolution to resist
a thing that you know to be wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom&rsquo;s words,&mdash;that hard rind
of truth which is discerned by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds. Maggie
always writhed under this judgment of Tom&rsquo;s; she rebelled and was
humiliated in the same moment; it seemed as if he held a glass before her to
show her her own folly and weakness, as if he were a prophetic voice predicting
her future fallings; and yet, all the while, she judged him in return; she said
inwardly that he was narrow and unjust, that he was below feeling those mental
needs which were often the source of the wrong-doing or absurdity that made her
life a planless riddle to him.
</p>

<p>
She did not answer directly; her heart was too full, and she sat down, leaning
her arm on the table. It was no use trying to make Tom feel that she was near
to him. He always repelled her. Her feeling under his words was complicated by
the allusion to the last scene between her father and Wakem; and at length that
painful, solemn memory surmounted the immediate grievance. No! She did not
think of such things with frivolous indifference, and Tom must not accuse her
of that. She looked up at him with a grave, earnest gaze and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you think better of me, Tom, by anything I can say.
But I am not so shut out from all your feelings as you believe me to be. I see
as well as you do that from our position with regard to Philip&rsquo;s
father&mdash;not on other grounds&mdash;it would be unreasonable, it would be
wrong, for us to entertain the idea of marriage; and I have given up thinking
of him as a lover. I am telling you the truth, and you have no right to
disbelieve me; I have kept my word to you, and you have never detected me in a
falsehood. I should not only not encourage, I should carefully avoid, any
intercourse with Philip on any other footing than of quiet friendship. You may
think that I am unable to keep my resolutions; but at least you ought not to
treat me with hard contempt on the ground of faults that I have not committed
yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Maggie,&rdquo; said Tom, softening under this appeal, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to overstrain matters. I think, all things considered, it will
be best for you to see Philip Wakem, if Lucy wishes him to come to the house. I
believe what you say,&mdash;at least you believe it yourself, I know; I can
only warn you. I wish to be as good a brother to you as you will let me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a little tremor in Tom&rsquo;s voice as he uttered the last words,
and Maggie&rsquo;s ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when they
were children, and bit their cake together as a sacrament of conciliation. She
rose and laid her hand on Tom&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Tom, I know you mean to be good. I know you have had a great deal
to bear, and have done a great deal. I should like to be a comfort to you, not
to vex you. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m altogether naughty, now, do
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom smiled at the eager face; his smiles were very pleasant to see when they
did come, for the gray eyes could be tender underneath the frown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I may turn out better than you expect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And may I come some day and make tea for you, and see this extremely
small wife of Bob&rsquo;s again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but trot away now, for I&rsquo;ve no more time to spare,&rdquo;
said Tom, looking at his watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to give me a kiss?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom bent to kiss her cheek, and then said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There! Be a good girl. I&rsquo;ve got a great deal to think of to-day.
I&rsquo;m going to have a long consultation with my uncle Deane this
afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to aunt Glegg&rsquo;s to-morrow? We&rsquo;re going all
to dine early, that we may go there to tea. You <i>must</i> come; Lucy told me
to say so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, pooh! I&rsquo;ve plenty else to do,&rdquo; said Tom, pulling his
bell violently, and bringing down the small bell-rope.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened; I shall run away,&rdquo; said Maggie, making a
laughing retreat; while Tom, with masculine philosophy, flung the bell-rope to
the farther end of the room; not very far either,&mdash;a touch of human
experience which I flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not a few
substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage of their rise
in the world, and were cherishing very large hopes in very small lodgings.

Showing That Tom Had Opened the Oyster</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ve settled this Newcastle business, Tom,&rdquo; said
Mr Deane, that same afternoon, as they were seated in the private room at the
Bank together, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another matter I want to talk to you about.
Since you&rsquo;re likely to have rather a smoky, unpleasant time of it at
Newcastle for the next few weeks, you&rsquo;ll want a good prospect of some
sort to keep up your spirits.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom waited less nervously than he had done on a former occasion in this
apartment, while his uncle took out his snuff-box and gratified each nostril
with deliberate impartiality.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, Tom,&rdquo; said Mr Deane at last, throwing himself backward,
&ldquo;the world goes on at a smarter pace now than it did when I was a young
fellow. Why, sir, forty years ago, when I was much such a strapping youngster
as you, a man expected to pull between the shafts the best part of his life,
before he got the whip in his hand. The looms went slowish, and fashions
didn&rsquo;t alter quite so fast; I&rsquo;d a best suit that lasted me six
years. Everything was on a lower scale, sir,&mdash;in point of expenditure, I
mean. It&rsquo;s this steam, you see, that has made the difference; it drives
on every wheel double pace, and the wheel of fortune along with &rsquo;em, as
our Mr Stephen Guest said at the anniversary dinner (he hits these things off
wonderfully, considering he&rsquo;s seen nothing of business). I don&rsquo;t
find fault with the change, as some people do. Trade, sir, opens a man&rsquo;s
eyes; and if the population is to get thicker upon the ground, as it&rsquo;s
doing, the world must use its wits at inventions of one sort or other. I know
I&rsquo;ve done my share as an ordinary man of business. Somebody has said
it&rsquo;s a fine thing to make two ears of corn grow where only one grew
before; but, sir, it&rsquo;s a fine thing, too, to further the exchange of
commodities, and bring the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry. And
that&rsquo;s our line of business; and I consider it as honourable a position
as a man can hold, to be connected with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom knew that the affair his uncle had to speak of was not urgent; Mr Deane
was too shrewd and practical a man to allow either his reminiscences or his
snuff to impede the progress of trade. Indeed, for the last month or two, there
had been hints thrown out to Tom which enabled him to guess that he was going
to hear some proposition for his own benefit. With the beginning of the last
speech he had stretched out his legs, thrust his hands in his pockets, and
prepared himself for some introductory diffuseness, tending to show that Mr
Deane had succeeded by his own merit, and that what he had to say to young men
in general was, that if they didn&rsquo;t succeed too it was because of their
own demerit. He was rather surprised, then, when his uncle put a direct
question to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see,&mdash;it&rsquo;s going on for seven years now since you
applied to me for a situation, eh, Tom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; I&rsquo;m three-and-twenty now,&rdquo; said Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s as well not to say that, though; for you&rsquo;d pass for
a good deal older, and age tells well in business. I remember your coming very
well; I remember I saw there was some pluck in you, and that was what made me
give you encouragement. And I&rsquo;m happy to say I was right; I&rsquo;m not
often deceived. I was naturally a little shy at pushing my nephew, but
I&rsquo;m happy to say you&rsquo;ve done me credit, sir; and if I&rsquo;d had a
son o&rsquo; my own, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been sorry to see him like
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane tapped his box and opened it again, repeating in a tone of some
feeling, &ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been sorry to see him like
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad I&rsquo;ve given you satisfaction, sir; I&rsquo;ve
done my best,&rdquo; said Tom, in his proud, independent way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Tom, you&rsquo;ve given me satisfaction. I don&rsquo;t speak of
your conduct as a son; though that weighs with me in my opinion of you. But
what I have to do with, as a partner in our firm, is the qualities you&rsquo;ve
shown as a man o&rsquo; business. Ours is a fine business,&mdash;a splendid
concern, sir,&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no reason why it shouldn&rsquo;t go on
growing; there&rsquo;s a growing capital, and growing outlets for it; but
there&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s wanted for the prosperity of every
concern, large or small, and that&rsquo;s men to conduct it,&mdash;men of the
right habits; none o&rsquo; your flashy fellows, but such as are to be depended
on. Now this is what Mr Guest and I see clear enough. Three years ago we took
Gell into the concern; we gave him a share in the oil-mill. And why? Why,
because Gell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium. So it will
always be, sir. So it was with me. And though Gell is pretty near ten years
older than you, there are other points in your favour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom was getting a little nervous as Mr Deane went on speaking; he was
conscious of something he had in his mind to say, which might not be agreeable
to his uncle, simply because it was a new suggestion rather than an acceptance
of the proposition he foresaw.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It stands to reason,&rdquo; Mr Deane went on, when he had finished his
new pinch, &ldquo;that your being my nephew weighs in your favour; but I
don&rsquo;t deny that if you&rsquo;d been no relation of mine at all, your
conduct in that affair of Pelley&rsquo;s bank would have led Mr Guest and
myself to make some acknowledgment of the service you&rsquo;ve been to us; and,
backed by your general conduct and business ability, it has made us determine
on giving you a share in the business,&mdash;a share which we shall be glad to
increase as the years go on. We think that&rsquo;ll be better, on all grounds,
than raising your salary. It&rsquo;ll give you more importance, and prepare you
better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by and by. I&rsquo;m
equal to a good deal o&rsquo; work at present, thank God; but I&rsquo;m getting
older,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no denying that. I told Mr Guest I would open the
subject to you; and when you come back from this northern business, we can go
into particulars. This is a great stride for a young fellow of
three-and-twenty, but I&rsquo;m bound to say you&rsquo;ve deserved it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very grateful to Mr Guest and you, sir; of course I feel the
most indebted to <i>you</i>, who first took me into the business, and have
taken a good deal of pains with me since.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom spoke with a slight tremor, and paused after he had said this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mr Deane. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t spare pains when I
see they&rsquo;ll be of any use. I gave myself some trouble with Gell, else he
wouldn&rsquo;t have been what he is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing I should like to mention to you uncle.
I&rsquo;ve never spoken to you of it before. If you remember, at the time my
father&rsquo;s property was sold, there was some thought of your firm buying
the Mill; I know you thought it would be a very good investment, especially if
steam were applied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, to be sure. But Wakem outbid us; he&rsquo;d made up his mind
to that. He&rsquo;s rather fond of carrying everything over other
people&rsquo;s heads.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s of no use my mentioning it at present,&rdquo; Tom
went on, &ldquo;but I wish you to know what I have in my mind about the Mill.
I&rsquo;ve a strong feeling about it. It was my father&rsquo;s dying wish that
I should try and get it back again whenever I could; it was in his family for
five generations. I promised my father; and besides that, I&rsquo;m attached to
the place. I shall never like any other so well. And if it should ever suit
your views to buy it for the firm, I should have a better chance of fulfilling
my father&rsquo;s wish. I shouldn&rsquo;t have liked to mention the thing to
you, only you&rsquo;ve been kind enough to say my services have been of some
value. And I&rsquo;d give up a much greater chance in life for the sake of
having the Mill again,&mdash;I mean having it in my own hands, and gradually
working off the price.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Deane had listened attentively, and now looked thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; he said, after a while; &ldquo;the thing would be
possible if there were any chance of Wakem&rsquo;s parting with the property.
But that I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> see. He&rsquo;s put that young Jetsome in the
place; and he had his reasons when he bought it, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a loose fish, that young Jetsome,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking to drinking, and they say he&rsquo;s letting the
business go down. Luke told me about it,&mdash;our old miller. He says he
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay unless there&rsquo;s an alteration. I was thinking, if
things went on that way, Wakem might be more willing to part with the Mill.
Luke says he&rsquo;s getting very sour about the way things are going
on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll turn it over, Tom. I must inquire into the matter, and
go into it with Mr Guest. But, you see, it&rsquo;s rather striking out a new
branch, and putting you to that, instead of keeping you where you are, which
was what we&rsquo;d wanted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should be able to manage more than the Mill when things were once set
properly going, sir. I want to have plenty of work. There&rsquo;s nothing else
I care about much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was something rather sad in that speech from a young man of
three-and-twenty, even in uncle Deane&rsquo;s business-loving ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh! you&rsquo;ll be having a wife to care about one of these
days, if you get on at this pace in the world. But as to this Mill, we
mustn&rsquo;t reckon on our chickens too early. However, I promise you to bear
it in mind, and when you come back we&rsquo;ll talk of it again. I am going to
dinner now. Come and breakfast with us to-morrow morning, and say good-bye to
your mother and sister before you start.&rdquo;

<h3><a name="chap45"></a>Chapter VI.<br/>
Illustrating the Laws of Attraction</h3>

<p>
It is evident to you now that Maggie had arrived at a moment in her life which
must be considered by all prudent persons as a great opportunity for a young
woman. Launched into the higher society of St Ogg&rsquo;s, with a striking
person, which had the advantage of being quite unfamiliar to the majority of
beholders, and with such moderate assistance of costume as you have seen
foreshadowed in Lucy&rsquo;s anxious colloquy with aunt Pullet, Maggie was
certainly at a new starting-point in life. At Lucy&rsquo;s first evening party,
young Torry fatigued his facial muscles more than usual in order that
&ldquo;the dark-eyed girl there in the corner&rdquo; might see him in all the
additional style conferred by his eyeglass; and several young ladies went home
intending to have short sleeves with black lace, and to plait their hair in a
broad coronet at the back of their head,&mdash;&ldquo;That cousin of Miss
Deane&rsquo;s looked so very well.&rdquo; In fact, poor Maggie, with all her
inward consciousness of a painful past and her presentiment of a troublous
future, was on the way to become an object of some envy,&mdash;a topic of
discussion in the newly established billiard-room, and between fair friends who
had no secrets from each other on the subject of trimmings. The Miss Guests,
who associated chiefly on terms of condescension with the families of St
Ogg&rsquo;s, and were the glass of fashion there, took some exception to
Maggie&rsquo;s manners. She had a way of not assenting at once to the
observations current in good society, and of saying that she didn&rsquo;t know
whether those observations were true or not, which gave her an air of
<i>gaucherie</i>, and impeded the even flow of conversation; but it is a fact
capable of an amiable interpretation that ladies are not the worst disposed
toward a new acquaintance of their own sex because she has points of
inferiority. And Maggie was so entirely without those pretty airs of coquetry
which have the traditional reputation of driving gentlemen to despair that she
won some feminine pity for being so ineffective in spite of her beauty. She had
not had many advantages, poor thing! and it must be admitted there was no
pretension about her; her abruptness and unevenness of manner were plainly the
result of her secluded and lowly circumstances. It was only a wonder that there
was no tinge of vulgarity about her, considering what the rest of poor
Lucy&rsquo;s relations were&mdash;an allusion which always made the Miss Guests
shudder a little. It was not agreeable to think of any connection by marriage
with such people as the Gleggs and the Pullets; but it was of no use to
contradict Stephen when once he had set his mind on anything, and certainly
there was no possible objection to Lucy in herself,&mdash;no one could help
liking her. She would naturally desire that the Miss Guests should behave
kindly to this cousin of whom she was so fond, and Stephen would make a great
fuss if they were deficient in civility. Under these circumstances the
invitations to Park House were not wanting; and elsewhere, also, Miss Deane was
too popular and too distinguished a member of society in St Ogg&rsquo;s for
any attention toward her to be neglected.
</p>

<p>
Thus Maggie was introduced for the first time to the young lady&rsquo;s life,
and knew what it was to get up in the morning without any imperative reason for
doing one thing more than another. This new sense of leisure and unchecked
enjoyment amidst the soft-breathing airs and garden-scents of advancing
spring&mdash;amidst the new abundance of music, and lingering strolls in the
sunshine, and the delicious dreaminess of gliding on the river&mdash;could
hardly be without some intoxicating effect on her, after her years of
privation; and even in the first week Maggie began to be less haunted by her
sad memories and anticipations. Life was certainly very pleasant just now; it
was becoming very pleasant to dress in the evening, and to feel that she was
one of the beautiful things of this spring-time. And there were admiring eyes
always awaiting her now; she was no longer an unheeded person, liable to be
chid, from whom attention was continually claimed, and on whom no one felt
bound to confer any. It was pleasant, too, when Stephen and Lucy were gone out
riding, to sit down at the piano alone, and find that the old fitness between
her fingers and the keys remained, and revived, like a sympathetic kinship not
to be worn out by separation; to get the tunes she had heard the evening
before, and repeat them again and again until she had found out a way of
producing them so as to make them a more pregnant, passionate language to her.
The mere concord of octaves was a delight to Maggie, and she would often take
up a book of studies rather than any melody, that she might taste more keenly
by abstraction the more primitive sensation of intervals. Not that her
enjoyment of music was of the kind that indicates a great specific talent; it
was rather that her sensibility to the supreme excitement of music was only one
form of that passionate sensibility which belonged to her whole nature, and
made her faults and virtues all merge in each other; made her affections
sometimes an impatient demand, but also prevented her vanity from taking the
form of mere feminine coquetry and device, and gave it the poetry of ambition.
But you have known Maggie a long while, and need to be told, not her
characteristics, but her history, which is a thing hardly to be predicted even
from the completest knowledge of characteristics. For the tragedy of our lives
is not created entirely from within. &ldquo;Character,&rdquo; says Novalis, in
one of his questionable aphorisms,&mdash;&ldquo;character is destiny.&rdquo;
But not the whole of our destiny. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was speculative
and irresolute, and we have a great tragedy in consequence. But if his father
had lived to a good old age, and his uncle had died an early death, we can
conceive Hamlet&rsquo;s having married Ophelia, and got through life with a
reputation of sanity, notwithstanding many soliloquies, and some moody sarcasms
toward the fair daughter of Polonius, to say nothing of the frankest incivility
to his father-in-law.
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s destiny, then, is at present hidden, and we must wait for it to
reveal itself like the course of an unmapped river; we only know that the river
is full and rapid, and that for all rivers there is the same final home. Under
the charm of her new pleasures, Maggie herself was ceasing to think, with her
eager prefiguring imagination, of her future lot; and her anxiety about her
first interview with Philip was losing its predominance; perhaps, unconsciously
to herself, she was not sorry that the interview had been deferred.
</p>

<p>
For Philip had not come the evening he was expected, and Mr Stephen Guest
brought word that he was gone to the coast,&mdash;probably, he thought, on a
sketching expedition; but it was not certain when he would return. It was just
like Philip, to go off in that way without telling any one. It was not until
the twelfth day that he returned, to find both Lucy&rsquo;s notes awaiting him;
he had left before he knew of Maggie&rsquo;s arrival.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one had need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of the feelings
that were crowded for Maggie into those twelve days; of the length to which
they were stretched for her by the novelty of her experience in them, and the
varying attitudes of her mind. The early days of an acquaintance almost always
have this importance for us, and fill up a larger space in our memory than
longer subsequent periods, which have been less filled with discovery and new
impressions. There were not many hours in those ten days in which Mr Stephen
Guest was not seated by Lucy&rsquo;s side, or standing near her at the piano,
or accompanying her on some outdoor excursion; his attentions were clearly
becoming more assiduous, and that was what every one had expected. Lucy was
very happy, all the happier because Stephen&rsquo;s society seemed to have
become much more interesting and amusing since Maggie had been there. Playful
discussions&mdash;sometimes serious ones&mdash;were going forward, in which
both Stephen and Maggie revealed themselves, to the admiration of the gentle,
unobtrusive Lucy; and it more than once crossed her mind what a charming
quartet they should have through life when Maggie married Philip. Is it an
inexplicable thing that a girl should enjoy her lover&rsquo;s society the more
for the presence of a third person, and be without the slightest spasm of
jealousy that the third person had the conversation habitually directed to her?
Not when that girl is as tranquil-hearted as Lucy, thoroughly possessed with a
belief that she knows the state of her companions&rsquo; affections, and not
prone to the feelings which shake such a belief in the absence of positive
evidence against it. Besides, it was Lucy by whom Stephen sat, to whom he gave
his arm, to whom he appealed as the person sure to agree with him; and every
day there was the same tender politeness toward her, the same consciousness of
her wants and care to supply them. Was there really the same? It seemed to Lucy
that there was more; and it was no wonder that the real significance of the
change escaped her. It was a subtle act of conscience in Stephen that even he
himself was not aware of. His personal attentions to Maggie were comparatively
slight, and there had even sprung up an apparent distance between them, that
prevented the renewal of that faint resemblance to gallantry into which he had
fallen the first day in the boat. If Stephen came in when Lucy was out of the
room, if Lucy left them together, they never spoke to each other; Stephen,
perhaps, seemed to be examining books or music, and Maggie bent her head
assiduously over her work. Each was oppressively conscious of the other&rsquo;s
presence, even to the finger-ends. Yet each looked and longed for the same
thing to happen the next day. Neither of them had begun to reflect on the
matter, or silently to ask, &ldquo;To what does all this tend?&rdquo; Maggie
only felt that life was revealing something quite new to her; and she was
absorbed in the direct, immediate experience, without any energy left for
taking account of it and reasoning about it. Stephen wilfully abstained from
self-questioning, and would not admit to himself that he felt an influence
which was to have any determining effect on his conduct. And when Lucy came
into the room again, they were once more unconstrained; Maggie could contradict
Stephen, and laugh at him, and he could recommend to her consideration the
example of that most charming heroine, Miss Sophia Western, who had a great
&ldquo;respect for the understandings of men.&rdquo; Maggie could look at
Stephen, which, for some reason or other she always avoided when they were
alone; and he could even ask her to play his accompaniment for him, since
Lucy&rsquo;s fingers were so busy with that bazaar-work, and lecture her on
hurrying the tempo, which was certainly Maggie&rsquo;s weak point.
</p>

<p>
One day&mdash;it was the day of Philip&rsquo;s return&mdash;Lucy had formed a
sudden engagement to spend the evening with Mrs Kenn, whose delicate state of
health, threatening to become confirmed illness through an attack of
bronchitis, obliged her to resign her functions at the coming bazaar into the
hands of other ladies, of whom she wished Lucy to be one. The engagement had
been formed in Stephen&rsquo;s presence, and he had heard Lucy promise to dine
early and call at six o&rsquo;clock for Miss Torry, who brought Mrs
Kenn&rsquo;s request.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here is another of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar,&rdquo;
Stephen burst forth, as soon as Miss Torry had left the
room,&mdash;&ldquo;taking young ladies from the duties of the domestic hearth
into scenes of dissipation among urn-rugs and embroidered reticules! I should
like to know what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons
for husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go
out. If this goes on much longer, the bonds of society will be
dissolved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it will not go on much longer,&rdquo; said Lucy, laughing,
&ldquo;for the bazaar is to take place on Monday week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;Kenn himself said the other
day that he didn&rsquo;t like this plan of making vanity do the work of
charity; but just as the British public is not reasonable enough to bear direct
taxation, so St Ogg&rsquo;s has not got force of motive enough to build and
endow schools without calling in the force of folly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo; said little Lucy, her hazel eyes opening wide with
anxiety. &ldquo;I never heard him say anything of that kind; I thought he
approved of what we were doing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he approves <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said Stephen, smiling at
her affectionately; &ldquo;your conduct in going out to-night looks vicious, I
own, but I know there is benevolence at the bottom of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you think too well of me,&rdquo; said Lucy, shaking her head, with a
pretty blush, and there the subject ended. But it was tacitly understood that
Stephen would not come in the evening; and on the strength of that tacit
understanding he made his morning visit the longer, not saying good-bye until
after four.
</p>

<p>
Maggie was seated in the drawing-room, alone, shortly after dinner, with Minny
on her lap, having left her uncle to his wine and his nap, and her mother to
the compromise between knitting and nodding, which, when there was no company,
she always carried on in the dining-room till tea-time. Maggie was stooping to
caress the tiny silken pet, and comforting him for his mistress&rsquo;s
absence, when the sound of a footstep on the gravel made her look up, and she
saw Mr Stephen Guest walking up the garden, as if he had come straight from
the river. It was very unusual to see him so soon after dinner! He often
complained that their dinner-hour was late at Park House. Nevertheless, there
he was, in his black dress; he had evidently been home, and must have come
again by the river. Maggie felt her cheeks glowing and her heart beating; it
was natural she should be nervous, for she was not accustomed to receive
visitors alone. He had seen her look up through the open window, and raised his
hat as he walked toward it, to enter that way instead of by the door. He
blushed too, and certainly looked as foolish as a young man of some wit and
self-possession can be expected to look, as he walked in with a roll of music
in his hand, and said, with an air of hesitating improvisation,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are surprised to see me again, Miss Tulliver; I ought to apologise
for coming upon you by surprise, but I wanted to come into the town, and I got
our man to row me; so I thought I would bring these things from the &lsquo;Maid
of Artois&rsquo; for your cousin; I forgot them this morning. Will you give
them to her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maggie, who had risen confusedly with Minny in her
arms, and now, not quite knowing what else to do, sat down again.
</p>

<p>
Stephen laid down his hat, with the music, which rolled on the floor, and sat
down in the chair close by her. He had never done so before, and both he and
Maggie were quite aware that it was an entirely new position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you pampered minion!&rdquo; said Stephen, leaning to pull the long
curly ears that drooped over Maggie&rsquo;s arm. It was not a suggestive
remark, and as the speaker did not follow it up by further development, it
naturally left the conversation at a standstill. It seemed to Stephen like some
action in a dream that he was obliged to do, and wonder at himself all the
while,&mdash;to go on stroking Minny&rsquo;s head. Yet it was very pleasant; he
only wished he dared look at Maggie, and that she would look at him,&mdash;let
him have one long look into those deep, strange eyes of hers, and then he would
be satisfied and quite reasonable after that. He thought it was becoming a sort
of monomania with him, to want that long look from Maggie; and he was racking
his invention continually to find out some means by which he could have it
without its appearing singular and entailing subsequent embarrassment. As for
Maggie, she had no distinct thought, only the sense of a presence like that of
a closely hovering broad-winged bird in the darkness, for she was unable to
look up, and saw nothing but Minny&rsquo;s black wavy coat.
</p>

<p>
But this must end some time, perhaps it ended very soon, and only <i>seemed</i>
long, as a minute&rsquo;s dream does. Stephen at last sat upright sideways in
his chair, leaning one hand and arm over the back and looking at Maggie. What
should he say?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall have a splendid sunset, I think; sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you go out
and see it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Maggie. Then courageously raising her
eyes and looking out of the window, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m not playing cribbage
with my uncle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A pause; during which Minny is stroked again, but has sufficient insight not to
be grateful for it, to growl rather.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like sitting alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A rather arch look came over Maggie&rsquo;s face, and, just glancing at
Stephen, she said, &ldquo;Would it be quite civil to say
&lsquo;yes&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It <i>was</i> rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask,&rdquo;
said Stephen, delighted with that glance, and getting determined to stay for
another. &ldquo;But you will have more than half an hour to yourself after I am
gone,&rdquo; he added, taking out his watch. &ldquo;I know Mr Deane never
comes in till half-past seven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another pause, during which Maggie looked steadily out of the window, till by a
great effort she moved her head to look down at Minny&rsquo;s back again, and
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish Lucy had not been obliged to go out. We lose our music.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall have a new voice to-morrow night,&rdquo; said Stephen.
&ldquo;Will you tell your cousin that our friend Philip Wakem is come back? I
saw him as I went home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie gave a little start,&mdash;it seemed hardly more than a vibration that
passed from head to foot in an instant. But the new images summoned by
Philip&rsquo;s name dispersed half the oppressive spell she had been under. She
rose from her chair with a sudden resolution, and laying Minny on his cushion,
went to reach Lucy&rsquo;s large work-basket from its corner. Stephen was vexed
and disappointed; he thought perhaps Maggie didn&rsquo;t like the name of Wakem
to be mentioned to her in that abrupt way, for he now recalled what Lucy had
told him of the family quarrel. It was of no use to stay any longer. Maggie was
seating herself at the table with her work, and looking chill and proud; and
he&mdash;he looked like a simpleton for having come. A gratuitous, entirely
superfluous visit of that sort was sure to make a man disagreeable and
ridiculous. Of course it was palpable to Maggie&rsquo;s thinking that he had
dined hastily in his own room for the sake of setting off again and finding her
alone.
</p>

<p>
A boyish state of mind for an accomplished young gentleman of five-and-twenty,
not without legal knowledge! But a reference to history, perhaps, may make it
not incredible.
</p>

<p>
At this moment Maggie&rsquo;s ball of knitting-wool rolled along the ground,
and she started up to reach it. Stephen rose too, and picking up the ball, met
her with a vexed, complaining look that gave his eyes quite a new expression to
Maggie, whose own eyes met them as he presented the ball to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Stephen, in a tone that had the same beseeching
discontent as his eyes. He dared not put out his hand; he thrust both hands
into his tail-pockets as he spoke. Maggie thought she had perhaps been rude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay?&rdquo; she said timidly, not looking away, for
that would have seemed rude again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Stephen, looking still into the
half-unwilling, half-fascinated eyes, as a thirsty man looks toward the track
of the distant brook. &ldquo;The boat is waiting for me. You&rsquo;ll tell your
cousin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I brought the music, I mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that Philip is come back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; (Maggie did not notice Philip&rsquo;s name this time.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come out a little way into the garden?&rdquo; said
Stephen, in a still gentler tone; but the next moment he was vexed that she did
not say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; for she moved away now toward the open window, and he
was obliged to take his hat and walk by her side. But he thought of something
to make him amends.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do take my arm,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone, as if it were a secret.
</p>

<p>
There is something strangely winning to most women in that offer of the firm
arm; the help is not wanted physically at that moment, but the sense of help,
the presence of strength that is outside them and yet theirs, meets a continual
want of the imagination. Either on that ground or some other, Maggie took the
arm. And they walked together round the grassplot and under the drooping green
of the laburnums, in the same dim, dreamy state as they had been in a quarter
of an hour before; only that Stephen had had the look he longed for, without
yet perceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness, and Maggie
had darting thoughts across the dimness,&mdash;how came he to be there? Why had
she come out? Not a word was spoken. If it had been, each would have been less
intensely conscious of the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take care of this step,&rdquo; said Stephen at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I will go in now,&rdquo; said Maggie, feeling that the step had come
like a rescue. &ldquo;Good-evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In an instant she had withdrawn her arm, and was running back to the house. She
did not reflect that this sudden action would only add to the embarrassing
recollections of the last half-hour. She had no thought left for that. She only
threw herself into the low arm-chair, and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip, Philip, I wish we were together again&mdash;so
quietly&mdash;in the Red Deeps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen looked after her a moment, then went on to the boat, and was soon
landed at the wharf. He spent the evening in the billiard-room, smoking one
cigar after another, and losing &ldquo;lives&rdquo; at pool. But he would not
leave off. He was determined not to think,&mdash;not to admit any more distinct
remembrance than was urged upon him by the perpetual presence of Maggie. He was
looking at her, and she was on his arm.
</p>

<p>
But there came the necessity of walking home in the cool starlight, and with it
the necessity of cursing his own folly, and bitterly determining that he would
never trust himself alone with Maggie again. It was all madness; he was in
love, thoroughly attached to Lucy, and engaged,&mdash;engaged as strongly as an
honourable man need be. He wished he had never seen this Maggie Tulliver, to be
thrown into a fever by her in this way; she would make a sweet, strange,
troublesome, adorable wife to some man or other, but he would never have chosen
her himself. Did she feel as he did? He hoped she did&mdash;not. He ought not
to have gone. He would master himself in future. He would make himself
disagreeable to her, quarrel with her perhaps. Quarrel with her? Was it
possible to quarrel with a creature who had such eyes,&mdash;defying and
deprecating, contradicting and clinging, imperious and beseeching,&mdash;full
of delicious opposites? To see such a creature subdued by love for one would be
a lot worth having&mdash;to another man.
</p>

<p>
There was a muttered exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy, as Stephen
threw away the end of his last cigar, and thrusting his hands into his pockets,
stalked along at a quieter pace through the shrubbery. It was not of a
benedictory kind.

<h3><a name="chap46"></a>Chapter VII.<br/>
Philip Re-enters</h3>

<p>
The next morning was very wet,&mdash;the sort of morning on which male
neighbours who have no imperative occupation at home are likely to pay their
fair friends an illimitable visit. The rain, which has been endurable enough
for the walk or ride one way, is sure to become so heavy, and at the same time
so certain to clear up by and by, that nothing but an open quarrel can
abbreviate the visit; latent detestation will not do at all. And if people
happen to be lovers, what can be so delightful, in England, as a rainy morning?
English sunshine is dubious; bonnets are never quite secure; and if you sit
down on the grass, it may lead to catarrhs. But the rain is to be depended on.
You gallop through it in a mackintosh, and presently find yourself in the seat
you like best,&mdash;a little above or a little below the one on which your
goddess sits (it is the same thing to the metaphysical mind, and that is the
reason why women are at once worshipped and looked down upon), with a
satisfactory confidence that there will be no lady-callers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stephen will come earlier this morning, I know,&rdquo; said Lucy;
&ldquo;he always does when it&rsquo;s rainy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie made no answer. She was angry with Stephen; she began to think she
should dislike him; and if it had not been for the rain, she would have gone to
her aunt Glegg&rsquo;s this morning, and so have avoided him altogether. As it
was, she must find some reason for remaining out of the room with her mother.
</p>

<p>
But Stephen did not come earlier, and there was another visitor&mdash;a nearer
neighbour&mdash;who preceded him. When Philip entered the room, he was going
merely to bow to Maggie, feeling that their acquaintance was a secret which he
was bound not to betray; but when she advanced toward him and put out her hand,
he guessed at once that Lucy had been taken into her confidence. It was a
moment of some agitation to both, though Philip had spent many hours in
preparing for it; but like all persons who have passed through life with little
expectation of sympathy, he seldom lost his self-control, and shrank with the
most sensitive pride from any noticeable betrayal of emotion. A little extra
paleness, a little tension of the nostril when he spoke, and the voice pitched
in rather a higher key, that to strangers would seem expressive of cold
indifference, were all the signs Philip usually gave of an inward drama that
was not without its fierceness. But Maggie, who had little more power of
concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been constructed of
musical strings, felt her eyes getting larger with tears as they took each
other&rsquo;s hands in silence. They were not painful tears; they had rather
something of the same origin as the tears women and children shed when they
have found some protection to cling to and look back on the threatened danger.
For Philip, who a little while ago was associated continually in Maggie&rsquo;s
mind with the sense that Tom might reproach her with some justice, had now, in
this short space, become a sort of outward conscience to her, that she might
fly to for rescue and strength. Her tranquil, tender affection for Philip, with
its root deep down in her childhood, and its memories of long quiet talk
confirming by distinct successive impressions the first instinctive
bias,&mdash;the fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to her pity and
womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic excitability of her
nature,&mdash;seemed now to make a sort of sacred place, a sanctuary where she
could find refuge from an alluring influence which the best part of herself
must resist; which must bring horrible tumult within, wretchedness without.
This new sense of her relation to Philip nullified the anxious scruples she
would otherwise have felt, lest she should overstep the limit of intercourse
with him that Tom would sanction; and she put out her hand to him, and felt the
tears in her eyes without any consciousness of an inward check. The scene was
just what Lucy expected, and her kind heart delighted in bringing Philip and
Maggie together again; though, even with all <i>her</i> regard for Philip, she
could not resist the impression that her cousin Tom had some excuse for feeling
shocked at the physical incongruity between the two,&mdash;a prosaic person
like cousin Tom, who didn&rsquo;t like poetry and fairy tales. But she began to
speak as soon as possible, to set them at ease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This was very good and virtuous of you,&rdquo; she said, in her pretty
treble, like the low conversational notes of little birds, &ldquo;to come so
soon after your arrival. And as it is, I think I will pardon you for running
away in an inopportune manner, and giving your friends no notice. Come and sit
down here,&rdquo; she went on, placing the chair that would suit him best,
&ldquo;and you shall find yourself treated mercifully.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will never govern well, Miss Deane,&rdquo; said Philip, as he seated
himself, &ldquo;because no one will ever believe in your severity. People will
always encourage themselves in misdemeanours by the certainty that you will be
indulgent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy gave some playful contradiction, but Philip did not hear what it was, for
he had naturally turned toward Maggie, and she was looking at him with that
open, affectionate scrutiny which we give to a friend from whom we have been
long separated. What a moment their parting had been! And Philip felt as if he
were only in the morrow of it. He felt this so keenly,&mdash;with such intense,
detailed remembrance, with such passionate revival of all that had been said
and looked in their last conversation,&mdash;that with that jealousy and
distrust which in diffident natures is almost inevitably linked with a strong
feeling, he thought he read in Maggie&rsquo;s glance and manner the evidence of
a change. The very fact that he feared and half expected it would be sure to
make this thought rush in, in the absence of positive proof to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am having a great holiday, am I not?&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;Lucy
is like a fairy godmother; she has turned me from a drudge into a princess in
no time. I do nothing but indulge myself all day long, and she always finds out
what I want before I know it myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure she is the happier for having you, then,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;You must be better than a whole menagerie of pets to her. And you look
well. You are benefiting by the change.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Artificial conversation of this sort went on a little while, till Lucy,
determined to put an end to it, exclaimed, with a good imitation of annoyance,
that she had forgotten something, and was quickly out of the room.
</p>

<p>
In a moment Maggie and Philip leaned forward, and the hands were clasped again,
with a look of sad contentment, like that of friends who meet in the memory of
recent sorrow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told my brother I wished to see you, Philip; I asked him to release me
from my promise, and he consented.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie, in her impulsiveness, wanted Philip to know at once the position they
must hold toward each other; but she checked herself. The things that had
happened since he had spoken of his love for her were so painful that she
shrank from being the first to allude to them. It seemed almost like an injury
toward Philip even to mention her brother,&mdash;her brother, who had insulted
him. But he was thinking too entirely of her to be sensitive on any other point
at that moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we can at least be friends, Maggie? There is nothing to hinder that
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will not your father object?&rdquo; said Maggie, withdrawing her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should not give you up on any ground but your own wish, Maggie,&rdquo;
said Philip, colouring. &ldquo;There are points on which I should always resist
my father, as I used to tell you. <i>That</i> is one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then there is nothing to hinder our being friends, Philip,&mdash;seeing
each other and talking to each other while I am here; I shall soon go away
again. I mean to go very soon, to a new situation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that inevitable, Maggie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I must not stay here long. It would unfit me for the life I must
begin again at last. I can&rsquo;t live in dependence,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t live
with my brother, though he is very good to me. He would like to provide for me;
but that would be intolerable to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent a few moments, and then said, in that high, feeble voice
which with him indicated the resolute suppression of emotion,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there no other alternative, Maggie? Is that life, away from those who
love you, the only one you will allow yourself to look forward to?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Philip,&rdquo; she said, looking at him pleadingly, as if she
entreated him to believe that she was compelled to this course. &ldquo;At
least, as things are; I don&rsquo;t know what may be in years to come. But I
begin to think there can never come much happiness to me from loving; I have
always had so much pain mingled with it. I wish I could make myself a world
outside it, as men do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you are returning to your old thought in a new form,
Maggie,&mdash;the thought I used to combat,&rdquo; said Philip, with a slight
tinge of bitterness. &ldquo;You want to find out a mode of renunciation that
will be an escape from pain. I tell you again, there is no such escape possible
except by perverting or mutilating one&rsquo;s nature. What would become of me,
if I tried to escape from pain? Scorn and cynicism would be my only opium;
unless I could fall into some kind of conceited madness, and fancy myself a
favourite of Heaven because I am not a favourite with men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The bitterness had taken on some impetuosity as Philip went on speaking; the
words were evidently an outlet for some immediate feeling of his own, as well
as an answer to Maggie. There was a pain pressing on him at that moment. He
shrank with proud delicacy from the faintest allusion to the words of love, of
plighted love that had passed between them. It would have seemed to him like
reminding Maggie of a promise; it would have had for him something of the
baseness of compulsion. He could not dwell on the fact that he himself had not
changed; for that too would have had the air of an appeal. His love for Maggie
was stamped, even more than the rest of his experience, with the exaggerated
sense that he was an exception,&mdash;that she, that every one, saw him in the
light of an exception.
</p>

<p>
But Maggie was conscience-stricken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Philip,&rdquo; she said, with her childish contrition when he used
to chide her, &ldquo;you are right, I know. I do always think too much of my
own feelings, and not enough of others&rsquo;,&mdash;not enough of yours. I had
need have you always to find fault with me and teach me; so many things have
come true that you used to tell me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was resting her elbow on the table, leaning her head on her hand and
looking at Philip with half-penitent dependent affection, as she said this;
while he was returning her gaze with an expression that, to her consciousness,
gradually became less vague,&mdash;became charged with a specific recollection.
Had his mind flown back to something that <i>she</i> now
remembered,&mdash;something about a lover of Lucy&rsquo;s? It was a thought
that made her shudder; it gave new definiteness to her present position, and to
the tendency of what had happened the evening before. She moved her arm from
the table, urged to change her position by that positive physical oppression at
the heart that sometimes accompanies a sudden mental pang.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter, Maggie? Has something happened?&rdquo; Philip said,
in inexpressible anxiety, his imagination being only too ready to weave
everything that was fatal to them both.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; said Maggie, rousing her latent will. Philip must
not have that odious thought in his mind; she would banish it from her own.
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;except in my own mind. You used to
say I should feel the effect of my starved life, as you called it; and I do. I
am too eager in my enjoyment of music and all luxuries, now they are come to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took up her work and occupied herself resolutely, while Philip watched her,
really in doubt whether she had anything more than this general allusion in her
mind. It was quite in Maggie&rsquo;s character to be agitated by vague
self-reproach. But soon there came a violent well-known ring at the door-bell
resounding through the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what a startling announcement!&rdquo; said Maggie, quite mistress of
herself, though not without some inward flutter. &ldquo;I wonder where Lucy
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy had not been deaf to the signal, and after an interval long enough for a
few solicitous but not hurried inquiries, she herself ushered Stephen in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, going straight up to Philip and
shaking him heartily by the hand, bowing to Maggie in passing,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s glorious to have you back again; only I wish you&rsquo;d
conduct yourself a little less like a sparrow with a residence on the
house-top, and not go in and out constantly without letting the servants know.
This is about the twentieth time I&rsquo;ve had to scamper up those countless
stairs to that painting-room of yours, all to no purpose, because your people
thought you were at home. Such incidents embitter friendship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve so few visitors, it seems hardly worth while to leave notice
of my exit and entrances,&rdquo; said Philip, feeling rather oppressed just
then by Stephen&rsquo;s bright strong presence and strong voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite well this morning, Miss Tulliver?&rdquo; said Stephen,
turning to Maggie with stiff politeness, and putting out his hand with the air
of fulfilling a social duty.
</p>

<p>
Maggie gave the tips of her fingers, and said, &ldquo;Quite well, thank
you,&rdquo; in a tone of proud indifference. Philip&rsquo;s eyes were watching
them keenly; but Lucy was used to seeing variations in their manner to each
other, and only thought with regret that there was some natural antipathy which
every now and then surmounted their mutual good-will. &ldquo;Maggie is not the
sort of woman Stephen admires, and she is irritated by something in him which
she interprets as conceit,&rdquo; was the silent observation that accounted for
everything to guileless Lucy. Stephen and Maggie had no sooner completed this
studied greeting than each felt hurt by the other&rsquo;s coldness. And
Stephen, while rattling on in questions to Philip about his recent sketching
expedition, was thinking all the more about Maggie because he was not drawing
her into the conversation as he had invariably done before. &ldquo;Maggie and
Philip are not looking happy,&rdquo; thought Lucy; &ldquo;this first interview
has been saddening to them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think we people who have not been galloping,&rdquo; she said to
Stephen, &ldquo;are all a little damped by the rain. Let us have some music. We
ought to take advantage of having Philip and you together. Give us the duet in
&lsquo;Masaniello&rsquo;; Maggie has not heard that, and I know it will suit
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said Stephen, going toward the piano, and giving a
foretaste of the tune in his deep &ldquo;brum-brum,&rdquo; very pleasant to
hear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You, please, Philip,&mdash;you play the accompaniment,&rdquo; said Lucy,
&ldquo;and then I can go on with my work. You <i>will</i> like to play,
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she added, with a pretty, inquiring look,
anxious, as usual, lest she should have proposed what was not pleasant to
another; but with yearnings toward her unfinished embroidery.
</p>

<p>
Philip had brightened at the proposition, for there is no feeling, perhaps,
except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find relief in
music,&mdash;that does not make a man sing or play the better; and Philip had
an abundance of pent-up feeling at this moment, as complex as any trio or
quartet that was ever meant to express love and jealousy and resignation and
fierce suspicion, all at the same time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, seating himself at the piano, &ldquo;it is a
way of eking out one&rsquo;s imperfect life and being three people at
once,&mdash;to sing and make the piano sing, and hear them both all the
while,&mdash;or else to sing and paint.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, there you are an enviable fellow. I can do nothing with my
hands,&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;That has generally been observed in men of
great administrative capacity, I believe,&mdash;a tendency to predominance of
the reflective powers in me! Haven&rsquo;t you observed that, Miss
Tulliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen had fallen by mistake into his habit of playful appeal to Maggie, and
she could not repress the answering flush and epigram.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>have</i> observed a tendency to predominance,&rdquo; she said,
smiling; and Philip at that moment devoutly hoped that she found the tendency
disagreeable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Lucy; &ldquo;music, music! We will discuss each
other&rsquo;s qualities another time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie always tried in vain to go on with her work when music began. She tried
harder than ever to-day; for the thought that Stephen knew how much she cared
for his singing was one that no longer roused a merely playful resistance; and
she knew, too, that it was his habit always to stand so that he could look at
her. But it was of no use; she soon threw her work down, and all her intentions
were lost in the vague state of emotion produced by the inspiring
duet,&mdash;emotion that seemed to make her at once strong and weak; strong for
all enjoyment, weak for all resistance. When the strain passed into the minor,
she half started from her seat with the sudden thrill of that change. Poor
Maggie! She looked very beautiful when her soul was being played on in this way
by the inexorable power of sound. You might have seen the slightest perceptible
quivering through her whole frame as she leaned a little forward, clasping her
hands as if to steady herself; while her eyes dilated and brightened into that
wide-open, childish expression of wondering delight which always came back in
her happiest moments. Lucy, who at other times had always been at the piano
when Maggie was looking in this way, could not resist the impulse to steal up
to her and kiss her. Philip, too, caught a glimpse of her now and then round
the open book on the desk, and felt that he had never before seen her under so
strong an influence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More, more!&rdquo; said Lucy, when the duet had been encored.
&ldquo;Something spirited again. Maggie always says she likes a great rush of
sound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be &lsquo;Let us take the road,&rsquo; then,&rdquo; said
Stephen,&mdash;&ldquo;so suitable for a wet morning. But are you prepared to
abandon the most sacred duties of life, and come and sing with us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Lucy, laughing. &ldquo;If you will look out the
&lsquo;Beggar&rsquo;s Opera&rsquo; from the large canterbury. It has a dingy
cover.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a great clue, considering there are about a score covers here of
rival dinginess,&rdquo; said Stephen, drawing out the canterbury.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, play something the while, Philip,&rdquo; said Lucy, noticing that
his fingers were wandering over the keys. &ldquo;What is that you are falling
into?&mdash;something delicious that I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo; said Philip, bringing out the tune
more definitely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the
&lsquo;Sonnambula&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! perchè non posso odiarti.&rsquo; I
don&rsquo;t know the opera, but it appears the tenor is telling the heroine
that he shall always love her though she may forsake him. You&rsquo;ve heard me
sing it to the English words, &lsquo;I love thee still.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not quite unintentionally that Philip had wandered into this song, which
might be an indirect expression to Maggie of what he could not prevail on
himself to say to her directly. Her ears had been open to what he was saying,
and when he began to sing, she understood the plaintive passion of the music.
That pleading tenor had no very fine qualities as a voice, but it was not quite
new to her; it had sung to her by snatches, in a subdued way, among the grassy
walks and hollows, and underneath the leaning ash-tree in the Red Deeps. There
seemed to be some reproach in the words; did Philip mean that? She wished she
had assured him more distinctly in their conversation that she desired not to
renew the hope of love between them, <i>only</i> because it clashed with her
inevitable circumstances. She was touched, not thrilled by the song; it
suggested distinct memories and thoughts, and brought quiet regret in the place
of excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with you tenors,&rdquo; said Stephen, who was
waiting with music in his hand while Philip finished the song. &ldquo;You
demoralise the fair sex by warbling your sentimental love and constancy under
all sorts of vile treatment. Nothing short of having your heads served up in a
dish like that mediæval tenor or troubadour, would prevent you from expressing
your entire resignation. I must administer an antidote, while Miss Deane
prepares to tear herself away from her bobbins.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen rolled out, with saucy energy,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Shall I, wasting in despair,<br/>
Die because a woman&rsquo;s fair?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
and seemed to make all the air in the room alive with a new influence. Lucy,
always proud of what Stephen did, went toward the piano with laughing, admiring
looks at him; and Maggie, in spite of her resistance to the spirit of the song
and to the singer, was taken hold of and shaken by the invisible
influence,&mdash;was borne along by a wave too strong for her.
</p>

<p>
But, angrily resolved not to betray herself, she seized her work, and went on
making false stitches and pricking her fingers with much perseverance, not
looking up or taking notice of what was going forward, until all the three
voices united in &ldquo;Let us take the road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I am afraid there would have been a subtle, stealing gratification in her mind
if she had known how entirely this saucy, defiant Stephen was occupied with
her; how he was passing rapidly from a determination to treat her with
ostentatious indifference to an irritating desire for some sign of inclination
from her,&mdash;some interchange of subdued word or look with her. It was not
long before he found an opportunity, when they had passed to the music of
&ldquo;The Tempest.&rdquo; Maggie, feeling the need of a footstool, was walking
across the room to get one, when Stephen, who was not singing just then, and
was conscious of all her movements, guessed her want, and flew to anticipate
her, lifting the footstool with an entreating look at her, which made it
impossible not to return a glance of gratitude. And then, to have the footstool
placed carefully by a too self-confident personage,&mdash;not <i>any</i>
self-confident personage, but one in particular, who suddenly looks humble and
anxious, and lingers, bending still, to ask if there is not some draught in
that position between the window and the fireplace, and if he may not be
allowed to move the work-table for her,&mdash;these things will summon a little
of the too ready, traitorous tenderness into a woman&rsquo;s eyes, compelled as
she is in her girlish time to learn her life-lessons in very trivial language.
And to Maggie such things had not been everyday incidents, but were a new
element in her life, and found her keen appetite for homage quite fresh. That
tone of gentle solicitude obliged her to look at the face that was bent toward
her, and to say, &ldquo;No, thank you&rdquo;; and nothing could prevent that
mutual glance from being delicious to both, as it had been the evening before.
</p>

<p>
It was but an ordinary act of politeness in Stephen; it had hardly taken two
minutes; and Lucy, who was singing, scarcely noticed it. But to Philip&rsquo;s
mind, filled already with a vague anxiety that was likely to find a definite
ground for itself in any trivial incident, this sudden eagerness in Stephen,
and the change in Maggie&rsquo;s face, which was plainly reflecting a beam from
his, seemed so strong a contrast with the previous overwrought signs of
indifference, as to be charged with painful meaning. Stephen&rsquo;s voice,
pouring in again, jarred upon his nervous susceptibility as if it had been the
clang of sheet-iron, and he felt inclined to make the piano shriek in utter
discord. He had really seen no communicable ground for suspecting any ususual
feeling between Stephen and Maggie; his own reason told him so, and he wanted
to go home at once that he might reflect coolly on these false images, till he
had convinced himself of their nullity. But then, again, he wanted to stay as
long as Stephen stayed,&mdash;always to be present when Stephen was present
with Maggie. It seemed to poor Philip so natural, nay, inevitable, that any man
who was near Maggie should fall in love with her! There was no promise of
happiness for her if she were beguiled into loving Stephen Guest; and this
thought emboldened Philip to view his own love for her in the light of a less
unequal offering. He was beginning to play very falsely under this deafening
inward tumult, and Lucy was looking at him in astonishment, when Mrs
Tulliver&rsquo;s entrance to summon them to lunch came as an excuse for
abruptly breaking off the music.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Mr Philip!&rdquo; said Mr Deane, when they entered the
dining-room, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen you for a long while. Your
father&rsquo;s not at home, I think, is he? I went after him to the office the
other day, and they said he was out of town.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been to Mudport on business for several days,&rdquo; said
Philip; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s come back now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As fond of his farming hobby as ever, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; said Philip, rather wondering at this sudden
interest in his father&rsquo;s pursuits.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr Deane, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got some land in his own
hands on this side the river as well as the other, I think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he has.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; continued Mr Deane, as he dispensed the pigeonpie, &ldquo;he
must find farming a heavy item,&mdash;an expensive hobby. I never had a hobby
myself, never would give in to that. And the worst of all hobbies are those
that people think they can get money at. They shoot their money down like corn
out of a sack then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy felt a little nervous under her father&rsquo;s apparently gratuitous
criticism of Mr Wakem&rsquo;s expenditure. But it ceased there, and Mr Deane
became unusually silent and meditative during his luncheon. Lucy, accustomed to
watch all indications in her father, and having reasons, which had recently
become strong, for an extra interest in what referred to the Wakems, felt an
unusual curiosity to know what had prompted her father&rsquo;s questions. His
subsequent silence made her suspect there had been some special reason for them
in his mind.
</p>

<p>
With this idea in her head, she resorted to her usual plan when she wanted to
tell or ask her father anything particular: she found a reason for her aunt
Tulliver to leaving the dining-room after dinner, and seated herself on a small
stool at her father&rsquo;s knee. Mr Deane, under those circumstances,
considered that he tasted some of the most agreeable moments his merits had
purchased him in life, notwithstanding that Lucy, disliking to have her hair
powdered with snuff, usually began by mastering his snuff-box on such
occasions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go to sleep yet, papa, <i>do</i> you?&rdquo; she
said, as she brought up her stool and opened the large fingers that clutched
the snuff-box.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, glancing at the reward of merit in the
decanter. &ldquo;But what do <i>you</i> want?&rdquo; he added, pinching the
dimpled chin fondly,&mdash;&ldquo;to coax some more sovereigns out of my pocket
for your bazaar? Eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I have no base motives at all to-day. I only want to talk, not to
beg. I want to know what made you ask Philip Wakem about his father&rsquo;s
farming to-day, papa? It seemed rather odd, because you never hardly say
anything to him about his father; and why should you care about Mr
Wakem&rsquo;s losing money by his hobby?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something to do with business,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, waving his hands,
as if to repel intrusion into that mystery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, papa, you always say Mr Wakem has brought Philip up like a girl;
how came you to think you should get any business knowledge out of him? Those
abrupt questions sounded rather oddly. Philip thought them queer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, child!&rdquo; said Mr Deane, willing to justify his social
demeanour, with which he had taken some pains in his upward progress.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a report that Wakem&rsquo;s mill and farm on the other
side of the river&mdash;Dorlcote Mill, your uncle Tulliver&rsquo;s, you
know&mdash;isn&rsquo;t answering so well as it did. I wanted to see if your
friend Philip would let anything out about his father&rsquo;s being tired of
farming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? Would you buy the mill, papa, if he would part with it?&rdquo; said
Lucy, eagerly. &ldquo;Oh, tell me everything; here, you shall have your
snuff-box if you&rsquo;ll tell me. Because Maggie says all their hearts are set
on Tom&rsquo;s getting back the mill some time. It was one of the last things
her father said to Tom, that he must get back the mill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, you little puss,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, availing himself of the
restored snuff-box. &ldquo;You must not say a word about this thing; do you
hear? There&rsquo;s very little chance of their getting the mill or of
anybody&rsquo;s getting it out of Wakem&rsquo;s hands. And if he knew that we
wanted it with a view to the Tulliver&rsquo;s getting it again, he&rsquo;d be
the less likely to part with it. It&rsquo;s natural, after what happened. He
behaved well enough to Tulliver before; but a horsewhipping is not likely to be
paid for with sugar-plums.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, papa,&rdquo; said Lucy, with a little air of solemnity, &ldquo;will
you trust me? You must not ask me all my reasons for what I&rsquo;m going to
say, but I have very strong reasons. And I&rsquo;m very cautious; I am,
indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, let us hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I believe, if you will let me take Philip Wakem into our
confidence,&mdash;let me tell him all about your wish to buy, and what
it&rsquo;s for; that my cousins wish to have it, and why they wish to have
it,&mdash;I believe Philip would help to bring it about. I know he would desire
to do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that can be, child,&rdquo; said Mr Deane, looking
puzzled. &ldquo;Why should <i>he</i> care?&rdquo;&mdash;then, with a sudden
penetrating look at his daughter, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think the poor
lad&rsquo;s fond of you, and so you can make him do what you like?&rdquo; (Mr
Deane felt quite safe about his daughter&rsquo;s affections.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, papa; he cares very little about me,&mdash;not so much as I care
about him. But I have a reason for being quite sure of what I say. Don&rsquo;t
you ask me. And if you ever guess, don&rsquo;t tell me. Only give me leave to
do as I think fit about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy rose from her stool to seat herself on her father&rsquo;s knee, and kissed
him with that last request.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure you won&rsquo;t do mischief, now?&rdquo; he said, looking
at her with delight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, papa, quite sure. I&rsquo;m very wise; I&rsquo;ve got all your
business talents. Didn&rsquo;t you admire my accompt-book, now, when I showed
it you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, if this youngster will keep his counsel, there won&rsquo;t
be much harm done. And to tell the truth, I think there&rsquo;s not much chance
for us any other way. Now, let me go off to sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap47"></a>Chapter VIII.<br/>
Wakem in a New Light</h3>

<p>
Before three days had passed after the conversation you have just overheard
between Lucy and her father she had contrived to have a private interview with
Philip during a visit of Maggie&rsquo;s to her aunt Glegg. For a day and a
night Philip turned over in his mind with restless agitation all that Lucy had
told him in that interview, till he had thoroughly resolved on a course of
action. He thought he saw before him now a possibility of altering his position
with respect to Maggie, and removing at least one obstacle between them. He
laid his plan and calculated all his moves with the fervid deliberation of a
chess-player in the days of his first ardor, and was amazed himself at his
sudden genius as a tactician. His plan was as bold as it was thoroughly
calculated. Having watched for a moment when his father had nothing more urgent
on his hands than the newspaper, he went behind him, laid a hand on his
shoulder, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father, will you come up into my sanctum, and look at my new sketches?
I&rsquo;ve arranged them now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting terrible stiff in the joints, Phil, for climbing those
stairs of yours,&rdquo; said Wakem, looking kindly at his son as he laid down
his paper. &ldquo;But come along, then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a nice place for you, isn&rsquo;t it, Phil?&mdash;a capital
light that from the roof, eh?&rdquo; was, as usual, the first thing he said on
entering the painting-room. He liked to remind himself and his son too that his
fatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation. He had been a good father.
Emily would have nothing to reproach him with there, if she came back again
from her grave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he said, putting his double eye-glass over his nose,
and seating himself to take a general view while he rested, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
got a famous show here. Upon my word, I don&rsquo;t see that your things
aren&rsquo;t as good as that London artist&rsquo;s&mdash;what&rsquo;s his
name&mdash;that Leyburn gave so much money for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shook his head and smiled. He had seated himself on his painting-stool,
and had taken a lead pencil in his hand, with which he was making strong marks
to counteract the sense of tremulousness. He watched his father get up, and
walk slowly round, good-naturedly dwelling on the pictures much longer than his
amount of genuine taste for landscape would have prompted, till he stopped
before a stand on which two pictures were placed,&mdash;one much larger than
the other, the smaller one in a leather case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless me! what have you here?&rdquo; said Wakem, startled by a sudden
transition from landscape to portrait. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d left off
figures. Who are these?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are the same person,&rdquo; said Philip, with calm promptness,
&ldquo;at different ages.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what person?&rdquo; said Wakem, sharply fixing his eyes with a
growing look of suspicion on the larger picture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Tulliver. The small one is something like what she was when I was
at school with her brother at King&rsquo;s Lorton; the larger one is not quite
so good a likeness of what she was when I came from abroad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wakem turned round fiercely, with a flushed face, letting his eye-glass fall,
and looking at his son with a savage expression for a moment, as if he was
ready to strike that daring feebleness from the stool. But he threw himself
into the armchair again, and thrust his hands into his trouser-pockets, still
looking angrily at his son, however. Philip did not return the look, but sat
quietly watching the point of his pencil.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And do you mean to say, then, that you have had any acquaintance with
her since you came from abroad?&rdquo; said Wakem, at last, with that vain
effort which rage always makes to throw as much punishment as it desires to
inflict into words and tones, since blows are forbidden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I saw a great deal of her for a whole year before her
father&rsquo;s death. We met often in that thicket&mdash;the Red
Deeps&mdash;near Dorlcote Mill. I love her dearly; I shall never love any other
woman. I have thought of her ever since she was a little girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, sir! And you have corresponded with her all this while?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I never told her I loved her till just before we parted, and she
promised her brother not to see me again or to correspond with me. I am not
sure that she loves me or would consent to marry me. But if she would
consent,&mdash;if she <i>did</i> love me well enough,&mdash;I should marry
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I&rsquo;ve
heaped on you?&rdquo; said Wakem, getting white, and beginning to tremble under
an enraged sense of impotence before Philip&rsquo;s calm defiance and
concentration of purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; said Philip, looking up at him for the first time;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regard it as a return. You have been an indulgent father
to me; but I have always felt that it was because you had an affectionate wish
to give me as much happiness as my unfortunate lot would admit, not that it was
a debt you expected me to pay by sacrificing all my chances of happiness to
satisfy feelings of yours which I can never share.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think most sons would share their father&rsquo;s feelings in this
case,&rdquo; said Wakem, bitterly. &ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s father was an
ignorant mad brute, who was within an inch of murdering me. The whole town
knows it. And the brother is just as insolent, only in a cooler way. He forbade
her seeing you, you say; he&rsquo;ll break every bone in your body, for your
greater happiness, if you don&rsquo;t take care. But you seem to have made up
your mind; you have counted the consequences, I suppose. Of course you are
independent of me; you can marry this girl to-morrow, if you like; you are a
man of five-and-twenty,&mdash;you can go your way, and I can go mine. We need
have no more to do with each other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wakem rose and walked toward the door, but something held him back, and instead
of leaving the room, he walked up and down it. Philip was slow to reply, and
when he spoke, his tone had a more incisive quietness and clearness than ever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t marry Miss Tulliver, even if she would have me, if I
have only my own resources to maintain her with. I have been brought up to no
profession. I can&rsquo;t offer her poverty as well as deformity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, <i>there</i> is a reason for your clinging to me, doubtless,&rdquo;
said Wakem, still bitterly, though Philip&rsquo;s last words had given him a
pang; they had stirred a feeling which had been a habit for a quarter of a
century. He threw himself into the chair again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expected all this,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I know these scenes are
often happening between father and son. If I were like other men of my age, I
might answer your angry words by still angrier; we might part; I should marry
the woman I love, and have a chance of being as happy as the rest. But if it
will be a satisfaction to you to annihilate the very object of everything
you&rsquo;ve done for me, you have an advantage over most fathers; you can
completely deprive me of the only thing that would make my life worth
having.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip paused, but his father was silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know best what satisfaction you would have, beyond that of
gratifying a ridiculous rancor worthy only of wandering savages.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ridiculous rancor!&rdquo; Wakem burst out. &ldquo;What do you mean? Damn
it! is a man to be horsewhipped by a boor and love him for it? Besides,
there&rsquo;s that cold, proud devil of a son, who said a word to me I shall
not forget when we had the settling. He would be as pleasant a mark for a
bullet as I know, if he were worth the expense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean your resentment toward them,&rdquo; said Philip, who
had his reasons for some sympathy with this view of Tom, &ldquo;though a
feeling of revenge is not worth much, that you should care to keep it. I mean
your extending the enmity to a helpless girl, who has too much sense and
goodness to share their narrow prejudices. <i>She</i> has never entered into
the family quarrels.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does that signify? We don&rsquo;t ask what a woman does; we ask
whom she belongs to. It&rsquo;s altogether a degrading thing to you, to think
of marrying old Tulliver&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For the first time in the dialogue, Philip lost some of his self-control, and
coloured with anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Tulliver,&rdquo; he said, with bitter incisiveness, &ldquo;has the
only grounds of rank that anything but vulgar folly can suppose to belong to
the middle class; she is thoroughly refined, and her friends, whatever else
they may be, are respected for irreproachable honour and integrity. All St
Ogg&rsquo;s, I fancy, would pronounce her to be more than my equal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wakem darted a glance of fierce question at his son; but Philip was not looking
at him, and with a certain penitent consciousness went on, in a few moments, as
if in amplification of his last words,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Find a single person in St Ogg&rsquo;s who will not tell you that a
beautiful creature like her would be throwing herself away on a pitiable object
like me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not she!&rdquo; said Wakem, rising again, and forgetting everything else
in a burst of resentful pride, half fatherly, half personal. &ldquo;It would be
a deuced fine match for her. It&rsquo;s all stuff about an accidental
deformity, when a girl&rsquo;s really attached to a man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But girls are not apt to get attached under those circumstances,&rdquo;
said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Wakem, rather brutally, trying to recover his
previous position, &ldquo;if she doesn&rsquo;t care for you, you might have
spared yourself the trouble of talking to me about her, and you might have
spared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely to
happen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wakem strode to the door, and without looking round again, banged it after him.
</p>

<p>
Philip was not without confidence that his father would be ultimately wrought
upon as he had expected, by what had passed; but the scene had jarred upon his
nerves, which were as sensitive as a woman&rsquo;s. He determined not to go
down to dinner; he couldn&rsquo;t meet his father again that day. It was
Wakem&rsquo;s habit, when he had no company at home, to go out in the evening,
often as early as half-past seven; and as it was far on in the afternoon now,
Philip locked up his room and went out for a long ramble, thinking he would not
return until his father was out of the house again. He got into a boat, and
went down the river to a favourite village, where he dined, and lingered till
it was late enough for him to return. He had never had any sort of quarrel with
his father before, and had a sickening fear that this contest, just begun,
might go on for weeks; and what might not happen in that time? He would not
allow himself to define what that involuntary question meant. But if he could
once be in the position of Maggie&rsquo;s accepted, acknowledged lover, there
would be less room for vague dread. He went up to his painting-room again, and
threw himself with a sense of fatigue into the armchair, looking round absently
at the views of water and rock that were ranged around, till he fell into a
doze, in which he fancied Maggie was slipping down a glistening, green, slimy
channel of a waterfall, and he was looking on helpless, till he was awakened by
what seemed a sudden, awful crash.
</p>

<p>
It was the opening of the door, and he could hardly have dozen more than a few
moments, for there was no perceptible change in the evening light. It was his
father who entered; and when Philip moved to vacate the chair for him, he
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit still. I&rsquo;d rather walk about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stalked up and down the room once or twice, and then, standing opposite
Philip with his hands thrust in his side pockets, he said, as if continuing a
conversation that had not been broken off,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this girl seems to have been fond of you, Phil, else she
wouldn&rsquo;t have met you in that way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart was beating rapidly, and a transient flush passed over his
face like a gleam. It was not quite easy to speak at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She liked me at King&rsquo;s Lorton, when she was a little girl, because
I used to sit with her brother a great deal when he had hurt his foot. She had
kept that in her memory, and thought of me as a friend of a long while ago. She
didn&rsquo;t think of me as a lover when she met me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but you made love to her at last. What did she say then?&rdquo;
said Wakem, walking about again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She said she <i>did</i> love me then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Confound it, then; what else do you want? Is she a jilt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was very young then,&rdquo; said Philip, hesitatingly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she hardly knew what she felt. I&rsquo;m afraid our
long separation, and the idea that events must always divide us, may have made
a difference.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s in the town. I&rsquo;ve seen her at church.
Haven&rsquo;t you spoken to her since you came back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, at Mr Deane&rsquo;s. But I couldn&rsquo;t renew my proposals to
her on several grounds. One obstacle would be removed if you would give your
consent,&mdash;if you would be willing to think of her as a
daughter-in-law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wakem was silent a little while, pausing before Maggie&rsquo;s picture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the sort of woman your mother was, though, Phil,&rdquo;
he said, at last. &ldquo;I saw her at church,&mdash;she&rsquo;s handsomer than
this,&mdash;deuced fine eyes and fine figure, I saw; but rather dangerous and
unmanageable, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very tender and affectionate, and so simple,&mdash;without
the airs and petty contrivances other women have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Wakem. Then looking round at his son, &ldquo;But your
mother looked gentler; she had that brown wavy hair and gray eyes, like yours.
You can&rsquo;t remember her very well. It was a thousand pities I&rsquo;d no
likeness of her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, shouldn&rsquo;t you be glad for me to have the same sort of
happiness, father, to sweeten my life for me? There can never be another tie so
strong to you as that which began eight-and-twenty years ago, when you married
my mother, and you have been tightening it ever since.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Phil, you&rsquo;re the only fellow that knows the best of me,&rdquo;
said Wakem, giving his hand to his son. &ldquo;We must keep together if we can.
And now, what am I to do? You must come downstairs and tell me. Am I to go and
call on this dark-eyed damsel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The barrier once thrown down in this way, Philip could talk freely to his
father of their entire relation with the Tullivers,&mdash;of the desire to get
the mill and land back into the family, and of its transfer to Guest &amp; Co.
as an intermediate step. He could venture now to be persuasive and urgent, and
his father yielded with more readiness than he had calculated on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t care about the mill,&rdquo; he said at last, with a
sort of angry compliance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had an infernal deal of bother
lately about the mill. Let them pay me for my improvements, that&rsquo;s all.
But there&rsquo;s one thing you needn&rsquo;t ask me. I shall have no direct
transactions with young Tulliver. If you like to swallow him for his
sister&rsquo;s sake, you may; but I&rsquo;ve no sauce that will make him go
down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I leave you to imagine the agreeable feelings with which Philip went to Mr
Deane the next day, to say that Mr Wakem was ready to open the negotiations,
and Lucy&rsquo;s pretty triumph as she appealed to her father whether she had
not proved her great business abilities. Mr Deane was rather puzzled, and
suspected that there had been something &ldquo;going on&rdquo; among the young
people to which he wanted a clew. But to men of Mr Deane&rsquo;s stamp, what
goes on among the young people is as extraneous to the real business of life as
what goes on among the birds and butterflies, until it can be shown to have a
malign bearing on monetary affairs. And in this case the bearing appeared to be
entirely propitious.

<h3><a name="chap48"></a>Chapter IX.<br/>
Charity in Full-Dress</h3>

<p>
The culmination of Maggie&rsquo;s career as an admired member of society in St
Ogg&rsquo;s was certainly the day of the bazaar, when her simple noble beauty,
clad in a white muslin of some soft-floating kind, which I suspect must have
come from the stores of aunt Pullet&rsquo;s wardrobe, appeared with marked
distinction among the more adorned and conventional women around her. We
perhaps never detect how much of our social demeanour is made up of artificial
airs until we see a person who is at once beautiful and simple; without the
beauty, we are apt to call simplicity awkwardness. The Miss Guests were much
too well-bred to have any of the grimaces and affected tones that belong to
pretentious vulgarity; but their stall being next to the one where Maggie sat,
it seemed newly obvious to-day that Miss Guest held her chin too high, and that
Miss Laura spoke and moved continually with a view to effect.
</p>

<p>
All well-dressed St Ogg&rsquo;s and its neighbourhood were there; and it would
have been worth while to come even from a distance, to see the fine old hall,
with its open roof and carved oaken rafters, and great oaken folding-doors, and
light shed down from a height on the many-coloured show beneath; a very quaint
place, with broad faded stripes painted on the walls, and here and there a show
of heraldic animals of a bristly, long-snouted character, the cherished emblems
of a noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall. A grand arch, cut
in the upper wall at one end, surmounted an oaken orchestra, with an open room
behind it, where hothouse plants and stalls for refreshments were disposed; an
agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed to loiter, and yet to exchange the
occasional crush down below for a more commodious point of view. In fact, the
perfect fitness of this ancient building for an admirable modern purpose, that
made charity truly elegant, and led through vanity up to the supply of a
deficit, was so striking that hardly a person entered the room without
exchanging the remark more than once. Near the great arch over the orchestra
was the stone oriel with painted glass, which was one of the venerable
inconsistencies of the old hall; and it was close by this that Lucy had her
stall, for the convenience of certain large plain articles which she had taken
charge of for Mrs Kenn. Maggie had begged to sit at the open end of the stall,
and to have the sale of these articles rather than of bead-mats and other
elaborate products of which she had but a dim understanding. But it soon
appeared that the gentlemen&rsquo;s dressing-gowns, which were among her
commodities, were objects of such general attention and inquiry, and excited so
troublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits, together
with a determination to test them by trying on, as to make her post a very
conspicuous one. The ladies who had commodities of their own to sell, and did
not want dressing-gowns, saw at once the frivolity and bad taste of this
masculine preference for goods which any tailor could furnish; and it is
possible that the emphatic notice of various kinds which was drawn toward Miss
Tulliver on this public occasion, threw a very strong and unmistakable light on
her subsequent conduct in many minds then present. Not that anger, on account
of spurned beauty can dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable ladies, but
rather that the errors of persons who have once been much admired necessarily
take a deeper tinge from the mere force of contrast; and also, that to-day
Maggie&rsquo;s conspicuous position, for the first time, made evident certain
characteristics which were subsequently felt to have an explanatory bearing.
There was something rather bold in Miss Tulliver&rsquo;s direct gaze, and
something undefinably coarse in the style of her beauty, which placed her, in
the opinion of all feminine judges, far below her cousin Miss Deane; for the
ladies of St Ogg&rsquo;s had now completely ceded to Lucy their hypothetic
claims on the admiration of Mr Stephen Guest.
</p>

<p>
As for dear little Lucy herself, her late benevolent triumph about the Mill,
and all the affectionate projects she was cherishing for Maggie and Philip,
helped to give her the highest spirits to-day, and she felt nothing but
pleasure in the evidence of Maggie&rsquo;s attractiveness. It is true, she was
looking very charming herself, and Stephen was paying her the utmost attention
on this public occasion; jealously buying up the articles he had seen under her
fingers in the process of making, and gayly helping her to cajole the male
customers into the purchase of the most effeminate futilities. He chose to lay
aside his hat and wear a scarlet fez of her embroidering; but by superficial
observers this was necessarily liable to be interpreted less as a compliment to
Lucy than as a mark of coxcombry. &ldquo;Guest is a great coxcomb,&rdquo; young
Torry observed; &ldquo;but then he is a privileged person in St
Ogg&rsquo;s&mdash;he carries all before him; if another fellow did such things,
everybody would say he made a fool of himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Stephen purchased absolutely nothing from Maggie, until Lucy said, in
rather a vexed undertone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See, now; all the things of Maggie&rsquo;s knitting will be gone, and
you will not have bought one. There are those deliciously soft warm things for
the wrists,&mdash;do buy them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;they must be intended for imaginative
persons, who can chill themselves on this warm day by thinking of the frosty
Caucasus. Stern reason is my forte, you know. You must get Philip to buy those.
By the way, why doesn&rsquo;t he come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He never likes going where there are many people, though I enjoined him
to come. He said he would buy up any of my goods that the rest of the world
rejected. But now, do go and buy something of Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; see, she has got a customer; there is old Wakem himself just
coming up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy&rsquo;s eyes turned with anxious interest toward Maggie to see how she
went through this first interview, since a sadly memorable time, with a man
toward whom she must have so strange a mixture of feelings; but she was pleased
to notice that Wakem had tact enough to enter at once into talk about the
bazaar wares, and appear interested in purchasing, smiling now and then kindly
at Maggie, and not calling on her to speak much, as if he observed that she was
rather pale and tremulous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin,&rdquo;
said Stephen, in an undertone to Lucy; &ldquo;is it pure magnanimity? You
talked of a family quarrel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that will soon be quite healed, I hope,&rdquo; said Lucy, becoming a
little indiscreet in her satisfaction, and speaking with an air of
significance. But Stephen did not appear to notice this, and as some
lady-purchasers came up, he lounged on toward Maggie&rsquo;s end, handling
trifles and standing aloof until Wakem, who had taken out his purse, had
finished his transactions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My son came with me,&rdquo; he overheard Wakem saying, &ldquo;but he has
vanished into some other part of the building, and has left all these
charitable gallantries to me. I hope you&rsquo;ll reproach him for his shabby
conduct.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She returned his smile and bow without speaking, and he turned away, only then
observing Stephen and nodding to him. Maggie, conscious that Stephen was still
there, busied herself with counting money, and avoided looking up. She had been
well pleased that he had devoted himself to Lucy to-day, and had not come near
her. They had begun the morning with an indifferent salutation, and both had
rejoiced in being aloof from each other, like a patient who has actually done
without his opium, in spite of former failures in resolution. And during the
last few days they had even been making up their minds to failures, looking to
the outward events that must soon come to separate them, as a reason for
dispensing with self-conquest in detail.
</p>

<p>
Stephen moved step by step as if he were being unwillingly dragged, until he
had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden by a screen of
draperies. Maggie went on counting her money till she suddenly heard a deep
gentle voice saying, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you very tried? Do let me bring you
something,&mdash;some fruit or jelly, mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The unexpected tones shook her like a sudden accidental vibration of a harp
close by her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, thank you,&rdquo; she said faintly, and only half looking up for
an instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look so pale,&rdquo; Stephen insisted, in a more entreating tone.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re exhausted. I must disobey you, and bring
something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, I couldn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you angry with me? What have I done? <i>Do</i> look at me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray, go away,&rdquo; said Maggie, looking at him helplessly, her eyes
glancing immediately from him to the opposite corner of the orchestra, which
was half hidden by the folds of the old faded green curtain. Maggie had no
sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the admission it implied;
but Stephen turned away at once, and following her upward glance, he saw Philip
Wakem sealed in the half-hidden corner, so that he could command little more
than that angle of the hall in which Maggie sat. An entirely new thought
occurred to Stephen, and linking itself with what he had observed of
Wakem&rsquo;s manner, and with Lucy&rsquo;s reply to his observation, it
convinced him that there had been some former relation between Philip and
Maggie beyond that childish one of which he had heard. More than one impulse
made him immediately leave the hall and go upstairs to the refreshment-room,
where, walking up to Philip, he sat down behind him, and put his hand on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you studying for a portrait, Phil,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or for a
sketch of that oriel window? By George, it makes a capital bit from this dark
corner, with the curtain just marking it off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have been studying expression,&rdquo; said Philip, curtly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! Miss Tulliver&rsquo;s? It&rsquo;s rather of the savage-moody order
to-day, I think,&mdash;something of the fallen princess serving behind a
counter. Her cousin sent me to her with a civil offer to get her some
refreshment, but I have been snubbed, as usual. There&rsquo;s natural antipathy
between us, I suppose; I have seldom the honour to please her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a hypocrite you are!&rdquo; said Philip, flushing angrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! because experience must have told me that I&rsquo;m universally
pleasing? I admit the law, but there&rsquo;s some disturbing force here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; said Philip, rising abruptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So am I&mdash;to get a breath of fresh air; this place gets oppressive.
I think I have done suit and service long enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two friends walked downstairs together without speaking. Philip turned
through the outer door into the court-yard; but Stephen, saying, &ldquo;Oh, by
the by, I must call in here,&rdquo; went on along the passage to one of the
rooms at the other end of the building, which were appropriated to the town
library. He had the room all to himself, and a man requires nothing less than
this when he wants to dash his cap on the table, throw himself astride a chair,
and stare at a high brick wall with a frown which would not have been beneath
the occasion if he had been slaying &ldquo;the giant Python.&rdquo; The conduct
that issues from a moral conflict has often so close a resemblance to vice that
the distinction escapes all outward judgments founded on a mere comparison of
actions. It is clear to you, I hope, that Stephen was not a
hypocrite,&mdash;capable of deliberate doubleness for a selfish end; and yet
his fluctuations between the indulgence of a feeling and the systematic
concealment of it might have made a good case in support of Philip&rsquo;s
accusation.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Maggie sat at her stall cold and trembling, with that painful
sensation in the eyes which comes from resolutely repressed tears. Was her life
to be always like this,&mdash;always bringing some new source of inward strife?
She heard confusedly the busy, indifferent voices around her, and wished her
mind could flow into that easy babbling current. It was at this moment that Dr
Kenn, who had quite lately come into the hall, and was now walking down the
middle with his hands behind him, taking a general view, fixed his eyes on
Maggie for the first time, and was struck with the expression of pain on her
beautiful face. She was sitting quite still, for the stream of customers had
lessened at this late hour in the afternoon; the gentlemen had chiefly chosen
the middle of the day, and Maggie&rsquo;s stall was looking rather bare. This,
with her absent, pained expression, finished the contrast between her and her
companions, who were all bright, eager, and busy. He was strongly arrested. Her
face had naturally drawn his attention as a new and striking one at church, and
he had been introduced to her during a short call on business at Mr
Deane&rsquo;s, but he had never spoken more than three words to her. He walked
toward her now, and Maggie, perceiving some one approaching, roused herself to
look up and be prepared to speak. She felt a childlike, instinctive relief from
the sense of uneasiness in this exertion, when she saw it was Dr Kenn&rsquo;s
face that was looking at her; that plain, middle-aged face, with a grave,
penetrating kindness in it, seeming to tell of a human being who had reached a
firm, safe strand, but was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers
still tossed by the waves, had an effect on Maggie at this moment which was
afterward remembered by her as if it had been a promise. The middle-aged, who
have lived through their strongest emotions, but are yet in the time when
memory is still half passionate and not merely contemplative, should surely be
a sort of natural priesthood, whom life has disciplined and consecrated to be
the refuge and rescue of early stumblers and victims of self-despair. Most of
us, at some moment in our young lives, would have welcomed a priest of that
natural order in any sort of canonicals or uncanonicals, but had to scramble
upward into all the difficulties of nineteen entirely without such aid, as
Maggie did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You find your office rather a fatiguing one, I fear, Miss
Tulliver,&rdquo; said Dr Kenn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is, rather,&rdquo; said Maggie, simply, not being accustomed to
simpler amiable denials of obvious facts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I can tell Mrs Kenn that you have disposed of her goods very
quickly,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;she will be very much obliged to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have done nothing; the gentlemen came very fast to buy the
dressing-gowns and embroidered waistcoats, but I think any of the other ladies
would have sold more; I didn&rsquo;t know what to say about them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr Kenn smiled. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m going to have you as a permanent
parishioner now, Miss Tulliver; am I? You have been at a distance from us
hitherto.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have been a teacher in a school, and I&rsquo;m going into another
situation of the same kind very soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah? I was hoping you would remain among your friends, who are all in
this neighbourhood, I believe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>I must go</i>,&rdquo; said Maggie, earnestly, looking at Dr Kenn
with an expression of reliance, as if she had told him her history in those
three words. It was one of those moments of implicit revelation which will
sometimes happen even between people who meet quite transiently,&mdash;on a
mile&rsquo;s journey, perhaps, or when resting by the wayside. There is always
this possibility of a word or look from a stranger to keep alive the sense of
human brotherhood.
</p>

<p>
Dr Kenn&rsquo;s ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief confidence
of Maggie&rsquo;s was charged with meaning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you feel it right to go. But that
will not prevent our meeting again, I hope; it will not prevent my knowing you
better, if I can be of any service to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put out his hand and pressed hers kindly before he turned away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has some trouble or other at heart,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Poor
child! she looks as if she might turn out to be one of
</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;The souls by nature pitched too high,<br/>
By suffering plunged too low.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wonderfully honest in those beautiful
eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It may be surprising that Maggie, among whose many imperfections an excessive
delight in admiration and acknowledged supremacy were not absent now, any more
than when she was instructing the gypsies with a view toward achieving a royal
position among them, was not more elated on a day when she had had the tribute
of so many looks and smiles, together with that satisfactory consciousness
which had necessarily come from being taken before Lucy&rsquo;s chevalglass,
and made to look at the full length of her tall beauty, crowned by the night of
her massy hair. Maggie had smiled at herself then, and for the moment had
forgotten everything in the sense of her own beauty. If that state of mind
could have lasted, her choice would have been to have Stephen Guest at her
feet, offering her a life filled with all luxuries, with daily incense of
adoration near and distant, and with all possibilities of culture at her
command. But there were things in her stronger than vanity,&mdash;passion and
affection, and long, deep memories of early discipline and effort, of early
claims on her love and pity; and the stream of vanity was soon swept along and
mingled imperceptibly with that wider current which was at its highest force
today, under the double urgency of the events and inward impulses brought by
the last week.
</p>

<p>
Philip had not spoken to her himself about the removal of obstacles between
them on his father&rsquo;s side,&mdash;he shrank from that; but he had told
everything to Lucy, with the hope that Maggie, being informed through her,
might give him some encouraging sign that their being brought thus much nearer
to each other was a happiness to her. The rush of conflicting feelings was too
great for Maggie to say much when Lucy, with a face breathing playful joy, like
one of Correggio&rsquo;s cherubs, poured forth her triumphant revelation; and
Lucy could hardly be surprised that she could do little more than cry with
gladness at the thought of her father&rsquo;s wish being fulfilled, and of
Tom&rsquo;s getting the Mill again in reward for all his hard striving. The
details of preparation for the bazaar had then come to usurp Lucy&rsquo;s
attention for the next few days, and nothing had been said by the cousins on
subjects that were likely to rouse deeper feelings. Philip had been to the
house more than once, but Maggie had had no private conversation with him, and
thus she had been left to fight her inward battle without interference.
</p>

<p>
But when the bazaar was fairly ended, and the cousins were alone again, resting
together at home, Lucy said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must give up going to stay with your aunt Moss the day after
to-morrow, Maggie; write a note to her, and tell her you have put it off at my
request, and I&rsquo;ll send the man with it. She won&rsquo;t be displeased;
you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to go by-and-by; and I don&rsquo;t want you to
go out of the way just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed I must go, dear; I can&rsquo;t put it off. I wouldn&rsquo;t
leave aunt Gritty out for the world. And I shall have very little time, for
I&rsquo;m going away to a new situation on the 25th of June.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie!&rdquo; said Lucy, almost white with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you, dear,&rdquo; said Maggie, making a great effort
to command herself, &ldquo;because you&rsquo;ve been so busy. But some time ago
I wrote to our old governess, Miss Firniss, to ask her to let me know if she
met with any situation that I could fill, and the other day I had a letter from
her telling me that I could take three orphan pupils of hers to the coast
during the holidays, and then make trial of a situation with her as teacher. I
wrote yesterday to accept the offer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy felt so hurt that for some moments she was unable to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;how could you be so unkind to
me&mdash;not to tell me&mdash;to take <i>such</i> a step&mdash;and now!&rdquo;
She hesitated a little, and then added, &ldquo;And Philip? I thought everything
was going to be so happy. Oh, Maggie, what is the reason? Give it up; let me
write. There is nothing now to keep you and Philip apart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maggie, faintly. &ldquo;There is Tom&rsquo;s feeling.
He said I must give him up if I married Philip. And I know he will not
change&mdash;at least not for a long while&mdash;unless something happened to
soften him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I will talk to him; he&rsquo;s coming back this week. And this good
news about the Mill will soften him. And I&rsquo;ll talk to him about Philip.
Tom&rsquo;s always very compliant to me; I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s so
obstinate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I must go,&rdquo; said Maggie, in a distressed voice. &ldquo;I must
leave some time to pack. Don&rsquo;t press me to stay, dear Lucy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy was silent for two or three minutes, looking away and ruminating. At
length she knelt down by her cousin, and looking up in her face with anxious
seriousness, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie, is it that you don&rsquo;t love Philip well enough to marry him?
Tell me&mdash;trust me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie held Lucy&rsquo;s hands tightly in silence a little while. Her own hands
were quite cold. But when she spoke, her voice was quite clear and distinct.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Lucy, I would choose to marry him. I think it would be the best and
highest lot for me,&mdash;to make his life happy. He loved me first. No one
else could be quite what he is to me. But I can&rsquo;t divide myself from my
brother for life. I must go away, and wait. Pray don&rsquo;t speak to me again
about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy obeyed in pain and wonder. The next word she said was,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, dear Maggie, at least you will go to the dance at Park House
to-morrow, and have some music and brightness, before you go to pay these dull
dutiful visits. Ah! here come aunty and the tea.&rdquo;
</p>

The Spell Seems Broken</h3>

<p>
The suite of rooms opening into each other at Park House looked duly brilliant
with lights and flowers and the personal splendors of sixteen couples, with
attendant parents and guardians. The focus of brilliancy was the long
drawing-room, where the dancing went forward, under the inspiration of the
grand piano; the library, into which it opened at one end, had the more sober
illumination of maturity, with caps and cards; and at the other end the pretty
sitting-room, with a conservatory attached, was left as an occasional cool
retreat. Lucy, who had laid aside her black for the first time, and had her
pretty slimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape, was the
acknowledged queen of the occasion; for this was one of the Miss Guests&rsquo;
thoroughly condescending parties, including no member of any aristocracy higher
than that of St Ogg&rsquo;s, and stretching to the extreme limits of
commercial and professional gentility.
</p>

<p>
Maggie at first refused to dance, saying that she had forgotten all the
figures&mdash;it was so many years since she had danced at school; and she was
glad to have that excuse, for it is ill dancing with a heavy heart. But at
length the music wrought in her young limbs, and the longing came; even though
it was the horrible young Torry, who walked up a second time to try and
persuade her. She warned him that she could not dance anything but a
country-dance; but he, of course, was willing to wait for that high felicity,
meaning only to be complimentary when he assured her at several intervals that
it was a &ldquo;great bore&rdquo; that she couldn&rsquo;t waltz, he would have
liked so much to waltz with her. But at last it was the turn of the good
old-fashioned dance which has the least of vanity and the most of merriment in
it, and Maggie quite forgot her troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of that
half-rustic rhythm which seems to banish pretentious etiquette. She felt quite
charitably toward young Torry, as his hand bore her along and held her up in
the dance; her eyes and cheeks had that fire of young joy in them which will
flame out if it can find the least breath to fan it; and her simple black
dress, with its bit of black lace, seemed like the dim setting of a jewel.
</p>

<p>
Stephen had not yet asked her to dance; had not yet paid her more than a
passing civility. Since yesterday, that inward vision of her which perpetually
made part of his consciousness, had been half screened by the image of Philip
Wakem, which came across it like a blot; there was some attachment between her
and Philip; at least there was an attachment on his side, which made her feel
in some bondage. Here, then, Stephen told himself, was another claim of honour
which called on him to resist the attraction that was continually threatening
to overpower him. He told himself so; and yet he had once or twice felt a
certain savage resistance, and at another moment a shuddering repugnance, to
this intrusion of Philip&rsquo;s image, which almost made it a new incitement
to rush toward Maggie and claim her for himself. Nevertheless, he had done what
he meant to do this evening,&mdash;he had kept aloof from her; he had hardly
looked at her; and he had been gayly assiduous to Lucy. But now his eyes were
devouring Maggie; he felt inclined to kick young Torry out of the dance, and
take his place. Then he wanted the dance to end that he might get rid of his
partner. The possibility that he too should dance with Maggie, and have her
hand in his so long, was beginning to possess him like a thirst. But even now
their hands were meeting in the dance,&mdash;were meeting still to the very end
of it, though they were far off each other.
</p>

<p>
Stephen hardly knew what happened, or in what automatic way he got through the
duties of politeness in the interval, until he was free and saw Maggie seated
alone again, at the farther end of the room. He made his way toward her round
the couples that were forming for the waltz; and when Maggie became conscious
that she was the person he sought, she felt, in spite of all the thoughts that
had gone before, a glowing gladness at heart. Her eyes and cheeks were still
brightened with her childlike enthusiasm in the dance; her whole frame was set
to joy and tenderness; even the coming pain could not seem bitter,&mdash;she
was ready to welcome it as a part of life, for life at this moment seemed a
keen, vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain. This one, this
last night, she might expand unrestrainedly in the warmth of the present,
without those chill, eating thoughts of the past and the future.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to waltz again,&rdquo; said Stephen, bending to
speak to her, with that glance and tone of subdued tenderness which young
dreams create to themselves in the summer woods when low, cooing voices fill
the air. Such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them into a
room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard flirtation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are going to waltz again. It is rather dizzy work to look on, and
the room is very warm; shall we walk about a little?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her hand and placed it within his arm, and they walked on into the
sitting-room, where the tables were strewn with engravings for the
accommodation of visitors who would not want to look at them. But no visitors
were here at this moment. They passed on into the conservatory.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights among
them!&rdquo; said Maggie, in a low voice. &ldquo;They look as if they belonged
to an enchanted land, and would never fade away; I could fancy they were all
made of jewels.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was looking at the tier of geraniums as she spoke, and Stephen made no
answer; but he was looking at her; and does not a supreme poet blend light and
sound into one, calling darkness mute, and light eloquent? Something strangely
powerful there was in the light of Stephen&rsquo;s long gaze, for it made
Maggie&rsquo;s face turn toward it and look upward at it, slowly, like a flower
at the ascending brightness. And they walked unsteadily on, without feeling
that they were walking; without feeling anything but that long, grave, mutual
gaze which has the solemnity belonging to all deep human passion. The hovering
thought that they must and would renounce each other made this moment of mute
confession more intense in its rapture.
</p>

<p>
But they had reached the end of the conservatory, and were obliged to pause and
turn. The change of movement brought a new consciousness to Maggie; she blushed
deeply, turned away her head, and drew her arm from Stephen&rsquo;s, going up
to some flowers to smell them. Stephen stood motionless, and still pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, may I get this rose?&rdquo; said Maggie, making a great effort to
say something, and dissipate the burning sense of irretrievable confession.
&ldquo;I think I am quite wicked with roses; I like to gather them and smell
them till they have no scent left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen was mute; he was incapable of putting a sentence together, and Maggie
bent her arm a little upward toward the large half-opened rose that had
attracted her. Who has not felt the beauty of a woman&rsquo;s arm? The
unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled elbow, and all
the varied gently lessening curves, down to the delicate wrist, with its
tiniest, almost imperceptible nicks in the firm softness. A woman&rsquo;s arm
touched the soul of a great sculptor two thousand years ago, so that he wrought
an image of it for the Parthenon which moves us still as it clasps lovingly the
timeworn marble of a headless trunk. Maggie&rsquo;s was such an arm as that,
and it had the warm tints of life.
</p>

<p>
A mad impulse seized on Stephen; he darted toward the arm, and showered kisses
on it, clasping the wrist.
</p>

<p>
But the next moment Maggie snatched it from him, and glared at him like a
wounded war-goddess, quivering with rage and humiliation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; She spoke in a deeply shaken, half-smothered voice.
&ldquo;What right have I given you to insult me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She darted from him into the adjoining room, and threw herself on the sofa,
panting and trembling.
</p>

<p>
A horrible punishment was come upon her for the sin of allowing a
moment&rsquo;s happiness that was treachery to Lucy, to Philip, to her own
better soul. That momentary happiness had been smitten with a blight, a
leprosy; Stephen thought more lightly of <i>her</i> than he did of Lucy.
</p>

<p>
As for Stephen, he leaned back against the framework of the conservatory, dizzy
with the conflict of passions,&mdash;love, rage, and confused despair; despair
at his want of self-mastery, and despair that he had offended Maggie.
</p>

<p>
The last feeling surmounted every other; to be by her side again and entreat
forgiveness was the only thing that had the force of a motive for him, and she
had not been seated more than a few minutes when he came and stood humbly
before her. But Maggie&rsquo;s bitter rage was unspent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave me to myself, if you please,&rdquo; she said, with impetuous
haughtiness, &ldquo;and for the future avoid me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen turned away, and walked backward and forward at the other end of the
room. There was the dire necessity of going back into the dancing-room again,
and he was beginning to be conscious of that. They had been absent so short a
time, that when he went in again the waltz was not ended.
</p>

<p>
Maggie, too, was not long before she re-entered. All the pride of her nature
was stung into activity; the hateful weakness which had dragged her within
reach of this wound to her self-respect had at least wrought its own cure. The
thoughts and temptations of the last month should all be flung away into an
unvisited chamber of memory. There was nothing to allure her now; duty would be
easy, and all the old calm purposes would reign peacefully once more. She
re-entered the drawing-room still with some excited brightness in her face, but
with a sense of proud self-command that defied anything to agitate her. She
refused to dance again, but she talked quite readily and calmly with every one
who addressed her. And when they got home that night, she kissed Lucy with a
free heart, almost exulting in this scorching moment, which had delivered her
from the possibility of another word or look that would have the stamp of
treachery toward that gentle, unsuspicious sister.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Maggie did not set off to Basset quite so soon as she had
expected. Her mother was to accompany her in the carriage, and household
business could not be dispatched hastily by Mrs Tulliver. So Maggie, who had
been in a hurry to prepare herself, had to sit waiting, equipped for the drive,
in the garden. Lucy was busy in the house wrapping up some bazaar presents for
the younger ones at Basset, and when there was a loud ring at the door-bell,
Maggie felt some alarm lest Lucy should bring out Stephen to her; it was sure
to be Stephen.
</p>

<p>
But presently the visitor came out into the garden alone, and seated himself by
her on the garden-chair. It was not Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can just catch the tips of the Scotch firs, Maggie, from this
seat,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
They had taken each other&rsquo;s hands in silence, but Maggie had looked at
him with a more complete revival of the old childlike affectionate smile than
he had seen before, and he felt encouraged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I often look at them, and wish I could see
the low sunlight on the stems again. But I have never been that way but
once,&mdash;to the churchyard with my mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have been there, I go there, continually,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I
have nothing but the past to live upon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A keen remembrance and keen pity impelled Maggie to put her hand in
Philip&rsquo;s. They had so often walked hand in hand!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember all the spots,&rdquo; she said,&mdash;&ldquo;just where you
told me of particular things, beautiful stories that I had never heard of
before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will go there again soon, won&rsquo;t you, Maggie?&rdquo; said
Philip, getting timid. &ldquo;The Mill will soon be your brother&rsquo;s home
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but I shall not be there,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;I shall only
hear of that happiness. I am going away again; Lucy has not told you,
perhaps?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then the future will never join on to the past again, Maggie? That book
is quite closed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gray eyes that had so often looked up at her with entreating worship,
looked up at her now, with a last struggling ray of hope in them, and Maggie
met them with her large sincere gaze.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That book never will be closed, Philip,&rdquo; she said, with grave
sadness; &ldquo;I desire no future that will break the ties of the past. But
the tie to my brother is one of the strongest. I can do nothing willingly that
will divide me always from him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that the only reason that would keep us apart forever, Maggie?&rdquo;
said Philip, with a desperate determination to have a definite answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only reason,&rdquo; said Maggie, with calm decision. And she
believed it. At that moment she felt as if the enchanted cup had been dashed to
the ground. The reactionary excitement that gave her a proud self-mastery had
not subsided, and she looked at the future with a sense of calm choice.
</p>

<p>
They sat hand in hand without looking at each other or speaking for a few
minutes; in Maggie&rsquo;s mind the first scenes of love and parting were more
present than the actual moment, and she was looking at Philip in the Red Deeps.
</p>

<p>
Philip felt that he ought to have been thoroughly happy in that answer of hers;
she was as open and transparent as a rock-pool. Why was he not thoroughly
happy? Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an omniscience that
would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.

<h3><a name="chap50"></a>Chapter XI.<br/>
In the Lane</h3>

<p>
Maggie had been four days at her aunt Moss&rsquo;s giving the early June
sunshine quite a new brightness in the care-dimmed eyes of that affectionate
woman, and making an epoch for her cousins great and small, who were learning
her words and actions by heart, as if she had been a transient avatar of
perfect wisdom and beauty.
</p>

<p>
She was standing on the causeway with her aunt and a group of cousins feeding
the chickens, at that quiet moment in the life of the farmyards before the
afternoon milking-time. The great buildings round the hollow yard were as
dreary and tumbledown as ever, but over the old garden-wall the straggling
rose-bushes were beginning to toss their summer weight, and the gray wood and
old bricks of the house, on its higher level, had a look of sleepy age in the
broad afternoon sunlight, that suited the quiescent time. Maggie, with her
bonnet over her arm, was smiling down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens,
when her aunt exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goodness me! who is that gentleman coming in at the gate?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a gentleman on a tall bay horse; and the flanks and neck of the horse
were streaked black with fast riding. Maggie felt a beating at head and heart,
horrible as the sudden leaping to life of a savage enemy who had feigned death.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is it, my dear?&rdquo; said Mrs Moss, seeing in Maggie&rsquo;s face
the evidence that she knew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is Mr Stephen Guest,&rdquo; said Maggie, rather faintly. &ldquo;My
cousin Lucy&rsquo;s&mdash;a gentleman who is very intimate at my
cousin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen was already close to them, had jumped off his horse, and now raised his
hat as he advanced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold the horse, Willy,&rdquo; said Mrs Moss to the twelve-year-old boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Stephen, pulling at the horse&rsquo;s
impatiently tossing head. &ldquo;I must be going again immediately. I have a
message to deliver to you, Miss Tulliver, on private business. May I take the
liberty of asking you to walk a few yards with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had a half-jaded, half-irritated look, such as a man gets when he has been
dogged by some care or annoyance that makes his bed and his dinner of little
use to him. He spoke almost abruptly, as if his errand were too pressing for
him to trouble himself about what would be thought by Mrs Moss of his visit
and request. Good Mrs Moss, rather nervous in the presence of this apparently
haughty gentleman, was inwardly wondering whether she would be doing right or
wrong to invite him again to leave his horse and walk in, when Maggie, feeling
all the embarrassment of the situation, and unable to say anything, put on her
bonnet, and turned to walk toward the gate.
</p>

<p>
Stephen turned too, and walked by her side, leading his horse.
</p>

<p>
Not a word was spoken till they were out in the lane, and had walked four or
five yards, when Maggie, who had been looking straight before her all the
while, turned again to walk back, saying, with haughty resentment,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no need for me to go any farther. I don&rsquo;t know whether
you consider it gentlemanly and delicate conduct to place me in a position that
forced me to come out with you, or whether you wished to insult me still
further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you are angry with me for coming,&rdquo; said Stephen,
bitterly. &ldquo;Of course it is of no consequence what a man has to suffer; it
is only your woman&rsquo;s dignity that you care about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie gave a slight start, such as might have come from the slightest possible
electric shock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As if it were not enough that I&rsquo;m entangled in this way; that
I&rsquo;m mad with love for you; that I resist the strongest passion a man can
feel, because I try to be true to other claims; but you must treat me as if I
were a coarse brute, who would willingly offend you. And when, if I had my own
choice, I should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and my whole life, and
do what you liked with them! I know I forgot myself. I took an unwarrantable
liberty. I hate myself for having done it. But I repented immediately;
I&rsquo;ve been repenting ever since. You ought not to think it unpardonable; a
man who loves with his whole soul, as I do you, is liable to be mastered by his
feelings for a moment; but you know&mdash;you must believe&mdash;that the worst
pain I could have is to have pained you; that I would give the world to recall
the error.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie dared not speak, dared not turn her head. The strength that had come
from resentment was all gone, and her lips were quivering visibly. She could
not trust herself to utter the full forgiveness that rose in answer to that
confession.
</p>

<p>
They were come nearly in front of the gate again, and she paused, trembling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must not say these things; I must not hear them,&rdquo; she said,
looking down in misery, as Stephen came in front of her, to prevent her from
going farther toward the gate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for any pain you
have to go through; but it is of no use to speak.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> of use,&rdquo; said Stephen, impetuously. &ldquo;It
would be of use if you would treat me with some sort of pity and consideration,
instead of doing me vile injustice in your mind. I could bear everything more
quietly if I knew you didn&rsquo;t hate me for an insolent coxcomb. Look at me;
see what a hunted devil I am; I&rsquo;ve been riding thirty miles every day to
get away from the thought of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie did not&mdash;dared not&mdash;look. She had already seen the harassed
face. But she said gently,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any evil of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, dearest, look at me,&rdquo; said Stephen, in deepest, tenderest
tones of entreaty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away from me yet. Give me a
moment&rsquo;s happiness; make me feel you&rsquo;ve forgiven me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I do forgive you,&rdquo; said Maggie, shaken by those tones, and
all the more frightened at herself. &ldquo;But pray let me go in again. Pray go
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A great tear fell from under her lowered eyelids.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go away from you; I can&rsquo;t leave you,&rdquo; said
Stephen, with still more passionate pleading. &ldquo;I shall come back again if
you send me away with this coldness; I can&rsquo;t answer for myself. But if
you will go with me only a little way I can live on that. You see plainly
enough that your anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie turned. But Tancred, the bay horse, began to make such spirited
remonstrances against this frequent change of direction, that Stephen, catching
sight of Willy Moss peeping through the gate, called out, &ldquo;Here! just
come and hold my horse for five minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Maggie, hurriedly, &ldquo;my aunt will think it so
strange.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Stephen answered impatiently; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t
know the people at St Ogg&rsquo;s. Lead him up and down just here for five
minutes,&rdquo; he added to Willy, who was now close to them; and then he
turned to Maggie&rsquo;s side, and they walked on. It was clear that she
<i>must</i> go on now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take my arm,&rdquo; said Stephen, entreatingly; and she took it, feeling
all the while as if she were sliding downward in a nightmare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no end to this misery,&rdquo; she began, struggling to repel
the influence by speech. &ldquo;It is wicked&mdash;base&mdash;ever allowing a
word or look that Lucy&mdash;that others might not have seen. Think of
Lucy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do think of her&mdash;bless her. If I
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Stephen had laid his hand on Maggie&rsquo;s
that rested on his arm, and they both felt it difficult to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I have other ties,&rdquo; Maggie went on, at last, with a desperate
effort, &ldquo;even if Lucy did not exist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are engaged to Philip Wakem?&rdquo; said Stephen, hastily. &ldquo;Is
it so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I consider myself engaged to him; I don&rsquo;t mean to marry any one
else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen was silent again until they had turned out of the sun into a side lane,
all grassy and sheltered. Then he burst out impetuously,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is unnatural, it is horrible. Maggie, if you loved me as I love you,
we should throw everything else to the winds for the sake of belonging to each
other. We should break all these mistaken ties that were made in blindness, and
determine to marry each other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would rather die than fall into that temptation,&rdquo; said Maggie,
with deep, slow distinctness, all the gathered spiritual force of painful years
coming to her aid in this extremity. She drew her arm from his as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me, then, that you don&rsquo;t care for me,&rdquo; he said, almost
violently. &ldquo;Tell me that you love some one else better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It darted through Maggie&rsquo;s mind that here was a mode of releasing herself
from outward struggle,&mdash;to tell Stephen that her whole heart was
Philip&rsquo;s. But her lips would not utter that, and she was silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you do love me, dearest,&rdquo; said Stephen, gently, taking her hand
again and laying it within his arm, &ldquo;it is better&mdash;it is right that
we should marry each other. We can&rsquo;t help the pain it will give. It is
come upon us without our seeking; it is natural; it has taken hold of me in
spite of every effort I have made to resist it. God knows, I&rsquo;ve been
trying to be faithful to tacit engagements, and I&rsquo;ve only made things
worse; I&rsquo;d better have given way at first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was silent. If it were <i>not</i> wrong&mdash;if she were once convinced
of that, and need no longer beat and struggle against this current, soft and
yet strong as the summer stream!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; dearest,&rdquo; said Stephen, leaning to look
entreatingly in her face. &ldquo;What could we care about in the whole world
beside, if we belonged to each other?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her breath was on his face, his lips were very near hers, but there was a great
dread dwelling in his love for her.
</p>

<p>
Her lips and eyelids quivered; she opened her eyes full on his for an instant,
like a lovely wild animal timid and struggling under caresses, and then turned
sharp round toward home again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And after all,&rdquo; he went on, in an impatient tone, trying to defeat
his own scruples as well as hers, &ldquo;I am breaking no positive engagement;
if Lucy&rsquo;s affections had been withdrawn from me and given to some one
else, I should have felt no right to assert a claim on her. If you are not
absolutely pledged to Philip, we are neither of us bound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that; it is not your real feeling,&rdquo; said
Maggie, earnestly. &ldquo;You feel, as I do, that the real tie lies in the
feelings and expectations we have raised in other minds. Else all pledges might
be broken, when there was no outward penalty. There would be no such thing as
faithfulness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen was silent; he could not pursue that argument; the opposite conviction
had wrought in him too strongly through his previous time of struggle. But it
soon presented itself in a new form.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The pledge <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be fulfilled,&rdquo; he said, with
impetuous insistence. &ldquo;It is unnatural; we can only pretend to give
ourselves to any one else. There is wrong in that too; there may be misery in
it for <i>them</i> as well as for us. Maggie, you must see that; you do see
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was looking eagerly at her face for the least sign of compliance; his large,
firm, gentle grasp was on her hand. She was silent for a few moments, with her
eyes fixed on the ground; then she drew a deep breath, and said, looking up at
him with solemn sadness,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it is difficult,&mdash;life is very difficult! It seems right to me
sometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling; but then, such feelings
continually come across the ties that all our former life has made for
us,&mdash;the ties that have made others dependent on us,&mdash;and would cut
them in two. If life were quite easy and simple, as it might have been in
Paradise, and we could always see that one being first toward whom&mdash;I
mean, if life did not make duties for us before love comes, love would be a
sign that two people ought to belong to each other. But I see&mdash;I feel it
is not so now; there are things we must renounce in life; some of us must
resign love. Many things are difficult and dark to me; but I see one thing
quite clearly,&mdash;that I must not, cannot, seek my own happiness by
sacrificing others. Love is natural; but surely pity and faithfulness and
memory are natural too. And they would live in me still, and punish me if I did
not obey them. I should be haunted by the suffering I had caused. Our love
would be poisoned. Don&rsquo;t urge me; help me,&mdash;help me, <i>because</i>
I love you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie had become more and more earnest as she went on; her face had become
flushed, and her eyes fuller and fuller of appealing love. Stephen had the
fibre of nobleness in him that vibrated to her appeal; but in the same
moment&mdash;how could it be otherwise?&mdash;that pleading beauty gained new
power over him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he said, in scarcely more than a whisper, while his arm
stole round her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll bear anything you wish.
But&mdash;one kiss&mdash;one&mdash;the last&mdash;before we part.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
One kiss, and then a long look, until Maggie said tremulously, &ldquo;Let me
go,&mdash;let me make haste back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hurried along, and not another word was spoken. Stephen stood still and
beckoned when they came within sight of Willy and the horse, and Maggie went on
through the gate. Mrs Moss was standing alone at the door of the old porch;
she had sent all the cousins in, with kind thoughtfulness. It might be a joyful
thing that Maggie had a rich and handsome lover, but she would naturally feel
embarrassed at coming in again; and it might <i>not</i> be joyful. In either
case Mrs Moss waited anxiously to receive Maggie by herself. The speaking face
told plainly enough that, if there was joy, it was of a very agitating, dubious
sort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down here a bit, my dear.&rdquo; She drew Maggie into the porch, and
sat down on the bench by her; there was no privacy in the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, aunt Gritty, I&rsquo;m very wretched! I wish I could have died when
I was fifteen. It seemed so easy to give things up then; it is so hard
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The poor child threw her arms round her aunt&rsquo;s neck, and fell into long,
deep sobs.

A Family Party</h3>

<p>
Maggie left her good aunt Gritty at the end of the week, and went to Garum Firs
to pay her visit to aunt Pullet according to agreement. In the mean time very
unexpected things had happened, and there was to be a family party at Garum to
discuss and celebrate a change in the fortunes of the Tullivers, which was
likely finally to carry away the shadow of their demerits like the last limb of
an eclipse, and cause their hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in
full-rounded splendor. It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come
into office are not the only fellow-men who enjoy a period of high appreciation
and full-blown eulogy; in many respectable families throughout this realm,
relatives becoming creditable meet with a similar cordiality of recognition,
which in its fine freedom from the coercion of any antecedents, suggests the
hopeful possibility that we may some day without any notice find ourselves in
full millennium, with cockatrices who have ceased to bite, and wolves that no
longer show their teeth with any but the blandest intentions.
</p>

<p>
Lucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg; for she longed to
have some undisturbed talk with Maggie about the wonderful news. It seemed, did
it not? said Lucy, with her prettiest air of wisdom, as if everything, even
other people&rsquo;s misfortunes (poor creatures!) were conspiring now to make
poor dear aunt Tulliver, and cousin Tom, and naughty Maggie too, if she were
not obstinately bent on the contrary, as happy as they deserved to be after all
their troubles. To think that the very day&mdash;the <i>very
day</i>&mdash;after Tom had come back from Newcastle, that unfortunate young
Jetsome, whom Mr Wakem had placed at the Mill, had been pitched off his horse
in a drunken fit, and was lying at St Ogg&rsquo;s in a dangerous state, so
that Wakem had signified his wish that the new purchasers should enter on the
premises at once!
</p>

<p>
It was very dreadful for that unhappy young man, but it did seem as if the
misfortune had happened then, rather than at any other time, in order that
cousin Tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his exemplary
conduct,&mdash;papa thought so very highly of him. Aunt Tulliver must certainly
go to the Mill now, and keep house for Tom; that was rather a loss to Lucy in
the matter of household comfort; but then, to think of poor aunty being in her
old place again, and gradually getting comforts about her there!
</p>

<p>
On this last point Lucy had her cunning projects, and when she and Maggie had
made their dangerous way down the bright stairs into the handsome parlour,
where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner than elsewhere, she directed her
manœuvres, as any other great tactician would have done, against the weaker
side of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aunt Pullet,&rdquo; she said, seating herself on the sofa, and
caressingly adjusting that lady&rsquo;s floating cap-string, &ldquo;I want you
to make up your mind what linen and things you will give Tom toward
housekeeping; because you are always so generous,&mdash;you give such nice
things, you know; and if you set the example, aunt Glegg will follow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That she never can, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, with unusual
vigor, &ldquo;for she hasn&rsquo;t got the linen to follow suit wi&rsquo; mine,
I can tell you. She&rsquo;d niver the taste, not if she&rsquo;d spend the
money. Big checks and live things, like stags and foxes, all her table-linen
is,&mdash;not a spot nor a diamond among &rsquo;em. But it&rsquo;s poor work
dividing one&rsquo;s linen before one dies,&mdash;I niver thought to ha&rsquo;
done that, Bessy,&rdquo; Mrs Pullet continued, shaking her head and looking at
her sister Tulliver, &ldquo;when you and me chose the double diamont, the first
flax iver we&rsquo;d spun, and the Lord knows where yours is gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no choice, I&rsquo;m sure, sister,&rdquo; said poor Mrs
Tulliver, accustomed to consider herself in the light of an accused person.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was no wish o&rsquo; mine, iver, as I should lie awake
o&rsquo; nights thinking o&rsquo; my best bleached linen all over the
country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take a peppermint, Mrs Tulliver,&rdquo; said uncle Pullet, feeling that
he was offering a cheap and wholesome form of comfort, which he was
recommending by example.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but, aunt Pullet,&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve so much
beautiful linen. And suppose you had had daughters! Then you must have divided
it when they were married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t say as I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet,
&ldquo;for now Tom&rsquo;s so lucky, it&rsquo;s nothing but right his friends
should look on him and help him. There&rsquo;s the tablecloths I bought at your
sale, Bessy; it was nothing but good natur&rsquo; o&rsquo; me to buy &rsquo;em,
for they&rsquo;ve been lying in the chest ever since. But I&rsquo;m not going
to give Maggie any more o&rsquo; my Indy muslin and things, if she&rsquo;s to
go into service again, when she might stay and keep me company, and do my
sewing for me, if she wasn&rsquo;t wanted at her brother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Going into service&rdquo; was the expression by which the Dodson mind
represented to itself the position of teacher or governess; and Maggie&rsquo;s
return to that menial condition, now circumstances offered her more eligible
prospects, was likely to be a sore point with all her relatives, besides Lucy.
Maggie in her crude form, with her hair down her back, and altogether in a
state of dubious promise, was a most undesirable niece; but now she was capable
of being at once ornamental and useful. The subject was revived in aunt and
uncle Glegg&rsquo;s presence, over the tea and muffins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hegh, hegh!&rdquo; said Mr Glegg, good-naturedly patting Maggie on the
back, &ldquo;nonsense, nonsense! Don&rsquo;t let us hear of you taking a place
again, Maggie. Why, you must ha&rsquo; picked up half-a-dozen sweethearts at
the bazaar; isn&rsquo;t there one of &rsquo;em the right sort of article? Come,
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said his wife, with that shade of increased politeness
in her severity which she always put on with her crisper fronts,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll excuse me, but you&rsquo;re far too light for a man of your
years. It&rsquo;s respect and duty to her aunts, and the rest of her kin as are
so good to her, should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again
without consulting us; not sweethearts, if I&rsquo;m to use such a word, though
it was never heared in <i>my</i> family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what did they call us, when we went to see &rsquo;em, then, eh,
neighbour Pullet? They thought us sweet enough then,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg,
winking pleasantly; while Mr Pullet, at the suggestion of sweetness, took a
little more sugar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said Mrs G., &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going to be
undelicate, let me know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;La, Jane, your husband&rsquo;s only joking,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet;
&ldquo;let him joke while he&rsquo;s got health and strength. There&rsquo;s
poor Mr Tilt got his mouth drawn all o&rsquo; one side, and couldn&rsquo;t
laugh if he was to try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you for the muffineer, then, Mr Glegg,&rdquo; said
Mrs G., &ldquo;if I may be so bold to interrupt your joking. Though it&rsquo;s
other people must see the joke in a niece&rsquo;s putting a slight on her
mother&rsquo;s eldest sister, as is the head o&rsquo; the family; and only
coming in and out on short visits, all the time she&rsquo;s been in the town,
and then settling to go away without my knowledge,&mdash;as I&rsquo;d laid caps
out on purpose for her to make &rsquo;em up for me,&mdash;and me as have
divided my money so equal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; Mrs Tulliver broke in anxiously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
Maggie never thought o&rsquo; going away without staying at your house as well
as the others. Not as it&rsquo;s my wish she should go away at all, but quite
contrairy. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m innocent. I&rsquo;ve said over and over
again, &lsquo;My dear, you&rsquo;ve no call to go away.&rsquo; But
there&rsquo;s ten days or a fortnight Maggie&rsquo;ll have before she&rsquo;s
fixed to go; she can stay at your house just as well, and I&rsquo;ll step in
when I can, and so will Lucy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bessy,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d exercise a little
more thought, you might know I should hardly think it was worth while to unpin
a bed, and go to all that trouble now, just at the end o&rsquo; the time, when
our house isn&rsquo;t above a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s walk from Mr
Deane&rsquo;s. She can come the first thing in the morning, and go back the
last at night, and be thankful she&rsquo;s got a good aunt so close to her to
come and sit with. I know <i>I</i> should, when I was her age.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;La, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs Pullet, &ldquo;it &rsquo;ud do your beds good
to have somebody to sleep in &rsquo;em. There&rsquo;s that striped room smells
dreadful mouldy, and the glass mildewed like anything. I&rsquo;m sure I thought
I should be struck with death when you took me in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there is Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy, clapping her hands.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s come on Sindbad, as I told him. I was afraid he was not going
to keep his promise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he entered, with strong feeling, at this first
meeting since the prospect of returning to the Mill had been opened to him; and
she kept his hand, leading him to the chair by her side. To have no cloud
between herself and Tom was still a perpetual yearning in her, that had its
root deeper than all change. He smiled at her very kindly this evening, and
said, &ldquo;Well, Magsie, how&rsquo;s aunt Moss?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, sir,&rdquo; said Mr Glegg putting out his hand. &ldquo;Why,
you&rsquo;re such a big man, you carry all before you, it, seems. You&rsquo;re
come into your luck a good deal earlier than us old folks did; but I wish you
joy, I wish you joy. You&rsquo;ll get the Mill all for your own again some day,
I&rsquo;ll be bound. You won&rsquo;t stop half-way up the hill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I hope he&rsquo;ll bear in mind as it&rsquo;s his mother&rsquo;s
family as he owes it to,&rdquo; said Mrs Glegg. &ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t had
them to take after, he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been poorly off. There was never any
failures, nor lawing, nor wastefulness in our family, nor dying without
wills&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, nor sudden deaths,&rdquo; said aunt Pullet; &ldquo;allays the doctor
called in. But Tom had the Dodson skin; I said that from the first. And I
don&rsquo;t know what <i>you</i> mean to do, sister Glegg, but I mean to give
him a tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one, besides sheets. I
don&rsquo;t say what more I shall do; but <i>that</i> I shall do, and if I
should die to-morrow, Mr Pullet, you&rsquo;ll bear it in mind,&mdash;though
you&rsquo;ll be blundering with the keys, and never remember as that on the
third shelf o&rsquo; the left-hand wardrobe, behind the night-caps with the
broad ties,&mdash;not the narrow-frilled uns,&mdash;is the key of the drawer in
the Blue Room, where the key o&rsquo; the Blue Closet is. You&rsquo;ll make a
mistake, and I shall niver be worthy to know it. You&rsquo;ve a memory for my
pills and draughts, wonderful,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll allays say that of
you,&mdash;but you&rsquo;re lost among the keys.&rdquo; This gloomy prospect of
the confusion that would ensue on her decease was very affecting to Mrs
Pullet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You carry it too far, Sophy,&mdash;that locking in and out,&rdquo; said
Mrs Glegg, in a tone of some disgust at this folly. &ldquo;You go beyond your
own family. There&rsquo;s nobody can say I don&rsquo;t lock up; but I do
what&rsquo;s reasonable, and no more. And as for the linen, I shall look out
what&rsquo;s serviceable, to make a present of to my nephey; I&rsquo;ve got
cloth as has never been whitened, better worth having than other people&rsquo;s
fine holland; and I hope he&rsquo;ll lie down in it and think of his
aunt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom thanked Mrs Glegg, but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on her
virtues; and Mrs Glegg effected a diversion for him by asking about Mr
Deane&rsquo;s intentions concerning steam.
</p>

<p>
Lucy had had her far-sighted views in begging Tom to come on Sindbad. It
appeared, when it was time to go home, that the man-servant was to ride the
horse, and cousin Tom was to drive home his mother and Lucy. &ldquo;You must
sit by yourself, aunty,&rdquo; said that contriving young lady, &ldquo;because
I must sit by Tom; I&rsquo;ve a great deal to say to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for Maggie, Lucy could not
persuade herself to defer a conversation about her with Tom, who, she thought,
with such a cup of joy before him as this rapid fulfilment of his wish about
the Mill, must become pliant and flexible. Her nature supplied her with no key
to Tom&rsquo;s; and she was puzzled as well as pained to notice the unpleasant
change on his countenance when she gave him the history of the way in which
Philip had used his influence with his father. She had counted on this
revelation as a great stroke of policy, which was to turn Tom&rsquo;s heart
toward Philip at once, and, besides that, prove that the elder Wakem was ready
to receive Maggie with all the honours of a daughter-in-law. Nothing was
wanted, then, but for dear Tom, who always had that pleasant smile when he
looked at cousin Lucy, to turn completely round, say the opposite of what he
had always said before, and declare that he, for his part, was delighted that
all the old grievances should be healed, and that Maggie should have Philip
with all suitable despatch; in cousin Lucy&rsquo;s opinion nothing could be
easier.
</p>

<p>
But to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities that create
severity,&mdash;strength of will, conscious rectitude of purpose, narrowness of
imagination and intellect, great power of self-control, and a disposition to
exert control over others,&mdash;prejudices come as the natural food of
tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that complex, fragmentary,
doubt-provoking knowledge which we call truth. Let a prejudice be bequeathed,
carried in the air, adopted by hearsay, caught in through the
eye,&mdash;however it may come, these minds will give it a habitation; it is
something to assert strongly and bravely, something to fill up the void of
spontaneous ideas, something to impose on others with the authority of
conscious right; it is at once a staff and a baton. Every prejudice that will
answer these purposes is self-evident. Our good, upright Tom Tulliver&rsquo;s
mind was of this class; his inward criticism of his father&rsquo;s faults did
not prevent him from adopting his father&rsquo;s prejudice; it was a prejudice
against a man of lax principle and lax life, and it was a meeting-point for all
the disappointed feelings of family and personal pride. Other feelings added
their force to produce Tom&rsquo;s bitter repugnance to Philip, and to
Maggie&rsquo;s union with him; and notwithstanding Lucy&rsquo;s power over her
strong-willed cousin, she got nothing but a cold refusal ever to sanction such
a marriage; &ldquo;but of course Maggie could do as she liked,&mdash;she had
declared her determination to be independent. For Tom&rsquo;s part, he held
himself bound by his duty to his father&rsquo;s memory, and by every manly
feeling, never to consent to any relation with the Wakems.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus, all that Lucy had effected by her zealous mediation was to fill
Tom&rsquo;s mind with the expectation that Maggie&rsquo;s perverse resolve to
go into a situation again would presently metamorphose itself, as her resolves
were apt to do, into something equally perverse, but entirely
different,&mdash;a marriage with Philip Wakem.

Borne Along by the Tide</h3>

<p>
In less than a week Maggie was at St Ogg&rsquo;s again,&mdash;outwardly in
much the same position as when her visit there had just begun. It was easy for
her to fill her mornings apart from Lucy without any obvious effort; for she
had her promised visits to pay to her aunt Glegg, and it was natural that she
should give her mother more than usual of her companionship in these last
weeks, especially as there were preparations to be thought of for Tom&rsquo;s
housekeeping. But Lucy would hear of no pretext for her remaining away in the
evenings; she must always come from aunt Glegg&rsquo;s before
dinner,&mdash;&ldquo;else what shall I have of you?&rdquo; said Lucy, with a
tearful pout that could not be resisted.
</p>

<p>
And Mr Stephen Guest had unaccountably taken to dining at Mr Deane&rsquo;s as
often as possible, instead of avoiding that, as he used to do. At first he
began his mornings with a resolution that he would not dine there, not even go
in the evening, till Maggie was away. He had even devised a plan of starting
off on a journey in this agreeable June weather; the headaches which he had
constantly been alleging as a ground for stupidity and silence were a
sufficient ostensible motive. But the journey was not taken, and by the fourth
morning no distinct resolution was formed about the evenings; they were only
foreseen as times when Maggie would still be present for a little
while,&mdash;when one more touch, one more glance, might be snatched. For why
not? There was nothing to conceal between them; they knew, they had confessed
their love, and they had renounced each other; they were going to part. Honour
and conscience were going to divide them; Maggie, with that appeal from her
inmost soul, had decided it; but surely they might cast a lingering look at
each other across the gulf, before they turned away never to look again till
that strange light had forever faded out of their eyes.
</p>

<p>
Maggie, all this time, moved about with a quiescence and even torpor of manner,
so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor, that Lucy would have
had to seek some other cause for such a change, if she had not been convinced
that the position in which Maggie stood between Philip and her brother, and the
prospect of her self-imposed wearisome banishment, were quite enough to account
for a large amount of depression. But under this torpor there was a fierce
battle of emotions, such as Maggie in all her life of struggle had never known
or foreboded; it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in
ambush till now, and had suddenly started up full-armed, with hideous,
overpowering strength! There were moments in which a cruel selfishness seemed
to be getting possession of her; why should not Lucy, why should not Philip,
suffer? <i>She</i> had had to suffer through many years of her life; and who
had renounced anything for her? And when something like that fulness of
existence&mdash;love, wealth, ease, refinement, all that her nature
craved&mdash;was brought within her reach, why was she to forego it, that
another might have it,&mdash;another, who perhaps needed it less? But amidst
all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making themselves
heard with rising power, till, from time to time, the tumult seemed quelled.
<i>Was</i> that existence which tempted her the full existence she dreamed?
Where, then, would be all the memories of early striving; all the deep pity for
another&rsquo;s pain, which had been nurtured in her through years of affection
and hardship; all the divine presentiment of something higher than mere
personal enjoyment, which had made the sacredness of life? She might as well
hope to enjoy walking by maiming her feet, as hope to enjoy an existence in
which she set out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs
of her soul. And then, if pain were so hard to <i>her</i>, what was it to
others? &ldquo;Ah, God! preserve me from inflicting&mdash;give me strength to
bear it.&rdquo; How had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she
would once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate crime? When
was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that
clashed with her truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken it from
her with horror, as if it had been a loathsome thing? And yet, since this
strange, sweet, subduing influence did not, should not, conquer
her,&mdash;since it was to remain simply her own suffering,&mdash;her mind was
meeting Stephen&rsquo;s in that thought of his, that they might still snatch
moments of mute confession before the parting came. For was not he suffering
too? She saw it daily&mdash;saw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which,
as soon as he was not compelled to exert himself, he relapsed into indifference
toward everything but the possibility of watching her. Could she refuse
sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her
like a low murmur of love and pain? She refused it less and less, till at last
the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment&rsquo;s mutual gaze;
they thought of it till it came, and when it had come, they thought of nothing
else.
</p>

<p>
One other thing Stephen seemed now and then to care for, and that was to sing;
it was a way of speaking to Maggie. Perhaps he was not distinctly conscious
that he was impelled to it by a secret longing&mdash;running counter to all his
self-confessed resolves&mdash;to deepen the hold he had on her. Watch your own
speech, and notice how it is guided by your less conscious purposes, and you
will understand that contradiction in Stephen.
</p>

<p>
Philip Wakem was a less frequent visitor, but he came occasionally in the
evening, and it happened that he was there when Lucy said, as they sat out on
the lawn, near sunset,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now Maggie&rsquo;s tale of visits to aunt Glegg is completed, I mean
that we shall go out boating every day until she goes. She has not had half
enough boating because of these tiresome visits, and she likes it better than
anything. Don&rsquo;t you, Maggie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better than any sort of locomotion, I hope you mean,&rdquo; said Philip,
smiling at Maggie, who was lolling backward in a low garden-chair; &ldquo;else
she will be selling her soul to that ghostly boatman who haunts the Floss, only
for the sake of being drifted in a boat forever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Should you like to be her boatman?&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Because, if
you would, you can come with us and take an oar. If the Floss were but a quiet
lake instead of a river, we should be independent of any gentleman, for Maggie
can row splendidly. As it is, we are reduced to ask services of knights and
squires, who do not seem to offer them with great alacrity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked playful reproach at Stephen, who was sauntering up and down, and was
just singing in pianissimo falsetto,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br/>
Doth ask a drink divine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took no notice, but still kept aloof; he had done so frequently during
Philip&rsquo;s recent visits.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem inclined for boating,&rdquo; said Lucy, when he
came to sit down by her on the bench. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t rowing suit you
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I hate a large party in a boat,&rdquo; he said, almost irritably.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come when you have no one else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy coloured, fearing that Philip would be hurt; it was quite a new thing for
Stephen to speak in that way; but he had certainly not been well of late.
Philip coloured too, but less from a feeling of personal offence than from a
vague suspicion that Stephen&rsquo;s moodiness had some relation to Maggie, who
had started up from her chair as he spoke, and had walked toward the hedge of
laurels to look at the descending sunlight on the river.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As Miss Deane didn&rsquo;t know she was excluding others by inviting
me,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;I am bound to resign.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, you shall not,&rdquo; said Lucy, much vexed. &ldquo;I
particularly wish for your company to-morrow. The tide will suit at half-past
ten; it will be a delicious time for a couple of hours to row to Luckreth and
walk back, before the sun gets too hot. And how can you object to four people
in a boat?&rdquo; she added, looking at Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t object to the people, but the number,&rdquo; said Stephen,
who had recovered himself, and was rather ashamed of his rudeness. &ldquo;If I
voted for a fourth at all, of course it would be you, Phil. But we won&rsquo;t
divide the pleasure of escorting the ladies; we&rsquo;ll take it alternately.
I&rsquo;ll go the next day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This incident had the effect of drawing Philip&rsquo;s attention with freshened
solicitude toward Stephen and Maggie; but when they re-entered the house, music
was proposed, and Mrs Tulliver and Mr Deane being occupied with cribbage,
Maggie sat apart near the table where the books and work were placed, doing
nothing, however, but listening abstractedly to the music. Stephen presently
turned to a duet which he insisted that Lucy and Philip should sing; he had
often done the same thing before; but this evening Philip thought he divined
some double intention in every word and look of Stephen&rsquo;s, and watched
him keenly, angry with himself all the while for this clinging suspicion. For
had not Maggie virtually denied any ground for his doubts on her side? And she
was truth itself; it was impossible not to believe her word and glance when
they had last spoken together in the garden. Stephen might be strongly
fascinated by her (what was more natural?), but Philip felt himself rather base
for intruding on what must be his friend&rsquo;s painful secret. Still he
watched. Stephen, moving away from the piano, sauntered slowly toward the table
near which Maggie sat, and turned over the newspapers, apparently in mere
idleness. Then he seated himself with his back to the piano, dragging a
newspaper under his elbow, and thrusting his hand through his hair, as if he
had been attracted by some bit of local news in the &ldquo;Laceham
Courier.&rdquo; He was in reality looking at Maggie who had not taken the
slightest notice of his approach. She had always additional strength of
resistance when Philip was present, just as we can restrain our speech better
in a spot that we feel to be hallowed. But at last she heard the word
&ldquo;dearest&rdquo; uttered in the softest tone of pained entreaty, like that
of a patient who asks for something that ought to have been given without
asking. She had never heard that word since the moments in the lane at Basset,
when it had come from Stephen again and again, almost as involuntarily as if it
had been an inarticulate cry. Philip could hear no word, but he had moved to
the opposite side of the piano, and could see Maggie start and blush, raise her
eyes an instant toward Stephen&rsquo;s face, but immediately look
apprehensively toward himself. It was not evident to her that Philip had
observed her; but a pang of shame, under the sense of this concealment, made
her move from her chair and walk to her mother&rsquo;s side to watch the game
at cribbage.
</p>

<p>
Philip went home soon after in a state of hideous doubt mingled with wretched
certainty. It was impossible for him now to resist the conviction that there
was some mutual consciousness between Stephen and Maggie; and for half the
night his irritable, susceptible nerves were pressed upon almost to frenzy by
that one wretched fact; he could attempt no explanation that would reconcile it
with her words and actions. When, at last, the need for belief in Maggie rose
to its habitual predominance, he was not long in imagining the truth,&mdash;she
was struggling, she was banishing herself; this was the clue to all he had seen
since his return. But athwart that belief there came other possibilities that
would not be driven out of sight. His imagination wrought out the whole story;
Stephen was madly in love with her; he must have told her so; she had rejected
him, and was hurrying away. But would he give her up, knowing&mdash;Philip felt
the fact with heart-crushing despair&mdash;that she was made half helpless by
her feeling toward him?
</p>

<p>
When the morning came, Philip was too ill to think of keeping his engagement to
go in the boat. In his present agitation he could decide on nothing; he could
only alternate between contradictory intentions. First, he thought he must have
an interview with Maggie, and entreat her to confide in him; then, again, he
distrusted his own interference. Had he not been thrusting himself on Maggie
all along? She had uttered words long ago in her young ignorance; it was enough
to make her hate him that these should be continually present with her as a
bond. And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she
had evidently intended to withhold from him? He would not trust himself to see
her, till he had assured himself that he could act from pure anxiety for her,
and not from egoistic irritation. He wrote a brief note to Stephen, and sent it
early by the servant, saying that he was not well enough to fulfil his
engagement to Miss Deane. Would Stephen take his excuse, and fill his place?
</p>

<p>
Lucy had arranged a charming plan, which had made her quite content with
Stephen&rsquo;s refusal to go in the boat. She discovered that her father was
to drive to Lindum this morning at ten; Lindum was the very place she wanted to
go to, to make purchases,&mdash;important purchases, which must by no means be
put off to another opportunity; and aunt Tulliver must go too, because she was
concerned in some of the purchases.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will have your row in the boat just the same, you know,&rdquo; she
said to Maggie when they went out of the breakfast-room and upstairs together;
&ldquo;Philip will be here at half-past ten, and it is a delicious morning. Now
don&rsquo;t say a word against it, you dear dolorous thing. What is the use of
my being a fairy godmother, if you set your face against all the wonders I work
for you? Don&rsquo;t think of awful cousin Tom; you may disobey him a
little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie did not persist in objecting. She was almost glad of the plan, for
perhaps it would bring her some strength and calmness to be alone with Philip
again; it was like revisiting the scene of a quieter life, in which the very
struggles were repose, compared with the daily tumult of the present. She
prepared herself for the boat and at half-past ten sat waiting in the
drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
The ring of the door-bell was punctual, and she was thinking with half-sad,
affectionate pleasure of the surprise Philip would have in finding that he was
to be with her alone, when she distinguished a firm, rapid step across the
hall, that was certainly not Philip&rsquo;s; the door opened, and Stephen Guest
entered.
</p>

<p>
In the first moment they were both too much agitated to speak; for Stephen had
learned from the servant that the others were gone out. Maggie had started up
and sat down again, with her heart beating violently; and Stephen, throwing
down his cap and gloves, came and sat by her in silence. She thought Philip
would be coming soon; and with great effort&mdash;for she trembled
visibly&mdash;she rose to go to a distant chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is not coming,&rdquo; said Stephen, in a low tone. &ldquo;I am going
in the boat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Maggie, sinking into her chair again.
&ldquo;Lucy did not expect&mdash;she would be hurt. Why is not Philip
come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is not well; he asked me to come instead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucy is gone to Lindum,&rdquo; said Maggie, taking off her bonnet with
hurried, trembling fingers. &ldquo;We must not go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Stephen, dreamily, looking at her, as he rested
his arm on the back of his chair. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was looking into her deep, deep eyes, far off and mysterious at the starlit
blackness, and yet very near, and timidly loving. Maggie sat perfectly
still&mdash;perhaps for moments, perhaps for minutes&mdash;until the helpless
trembling had ceased, and there was a warm glow on her check.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man is waiting; he has taken the cushions,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Will you go and tell him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What shall I tell him?&rdquo; said Stephen, almost in a whisper. He was
looking at the lips now.
</p>

<p>
Maggie made no answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; Stephen murmured entreatingly, rising, and taking her
hand to raise her too. &ldquo;We shall not be long together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And they went. Maggie felt that she was being led down the garden among the
roses, being helped with firm, tender care into the boat, having the cushion
and cloak arranged for her feet, and her parasol opened for her (which she had
forgotten), all by this stronger presence that seemed to bear her along without
any act of her own will, like the added self which comes with the sudden
exalting influence of a strong tonic, and she felt nothing else. Memory was
excluded.
</p>

<p>
They glided rapidly along, Stephen rowing, helped by the backward-flowing tide,
past the Tofton trees and houses; on between the silent sunny fields and
pastures, which seemed filled with a natural joy that had no reproach for
theirs. The breath of the young, unwearied day, the delicious rhythmic dip of
the oars, the fragmentary song of a passing bird heard now and then, as if it
were only the overflowing of brimful gladness, the sweet solitude of a twofold
consciousness that was mingled into one by that grave, untiring gaze which need
not be averted,&mdash;what else could there be in their minds for the first
hour? Some low, subdued, languid exclamation of love came from Stephen from
time to time, as he went on rowing idly, half automatically; otherwise they
spoke no word; for what could words have been but an inlet to thought? and
thought did not belong to that enchanted haze in which they were
enveloped,&mdash;it belonged to the past and the future that lay outside the
haze. Maggie was only dimly conscious of the banks, as they passed them, and
dwelt with no recognition on the villages; she knew there were several to be
passed before they reached Luckreth, where they always stopped and left the
boat. At all times she was so liable to fits of absence, that she was likely
enough to let her waymarks pass unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
But at last Stephen, who had been rowing more and more idly, ceased to row,
laid down the oars, folded his arms, and looked down on the water as if
watching the pace at which the boat glided without his help. This sudden change
roused Maggie. She looked at the far-stretching fields, at the banks close by,
and felt that they were entirely strange to her. A terrible alarm took
possession of her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, have we passed Luckreth, where we were to stop?&rdquo; she
exclaimed, looking back to see if the place were out of sight. No village was
to be seen. She turned around again, with a look of distressed questioning at
Stephen.
</p>

<p>
He went on watching the water, and said, in a strange, dreamy, absent tone,
&ldquo;Yes, a long way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what shall I do?&rdquo; cried Maggie, in an agony. &ldquo;We shall
not get home for hours, and Lucy? O God, help me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She clasped her hands and broke into a sob, like a frightened child; she
thought of nothing but of meeting Lucy, and seeing her look of pained surprise
and doubt, perhaps of just upbraiding.
</p>

<p>
Stephen moved and sat near her, and gently drew down the clasped hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; he said, in a deep tone of slow decision, &ldquo;let us
never go home again, till no one can part us,&mdash;till we are married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The unusual tone, the startling words, arrested Maggie&rsquo;s sob, and she sat
quite still, wondering; as if Stephen might have seen some possibilities that
would alter everything, and annul the wretched facts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See, Maggie, how everything has come without our seeking,&mdash;in spite
of all our efforts. We never thought of being alone together again; it has all
been done by others. See how the tide is carrying us out, away from all those
unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster round us, and trying in
vain. It will carry us on to Torby, and we can land there, and get some
carriage, and hurry on to York and then to Scotland,&mdash;and never pause a
moment till we are bound to each other, so that only death can part us. It is
the only right thing, dearest; it is the only way of escaping from this
wretched entanglement. Everything has concurred to point it out to us. We have
contrived nothing, we have thought of nothing ourselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen spoke with deep, earnest pleading. Maggie listened, passing from her
startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that the tide was doing
it all, that she might glide along with the swift, silent stream, and not
struggle any more. But across that stealing influence came the terrible shadow
of past thoughts; and the sudden horror lest now, at last, the moment of fatal
intoxication was close upon her, called up feelings of angry resistance toward
Stephen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she said, in an agitated tone, flashing an indignant
look at him, and trying to get her hands free. &ldquo;You have wanted to
deprive me of any choice. You knew we were come too far; you have dared to take
advantage of my thoughtlessness. It is unmanly to bring me into such a
position.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stung by this reproach, he released her hands, moved back to his former place,
and folded his arms, in a sort of desperation at the difficulty Maggie&rsquo;s
words had made present to him. If she would not consent to go on, he must curse
himself for the embarrassment he had led her into. But the reproach was the
unendurable thing; the one thing worse than parting with her was, that she
should feel he had acted unworthily toward her. At last he said, in a tone of
suppressed rage,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice that we had passed Luckreth till we had got to the
next village; and then it came into my mind that we would go on. I can&rsquo;t
justify it; I ought to have told you. It is enough to make you hate me, since
you don&rsquo;t love me well enough to make everything else indifferent to you,
as I do you. Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here? I&rsquo;ll tell
Lucy that I was mad, and that you hate me; and you shall be clear of me
forever. No one can blame you, because I have behaved unpardonably to
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was paralyzed; it was easier to resist Stephen&rsquo;s pleading than
this picture he had called up of himself suffering while she was vindicated;
easier even to turn away from his look of tenderness than from this look of
angry misery, that seemed to place her in selfish isolation from him. He had
called up a state of feeling in which the reasons which had acted on her
conscience seemed to be transmitted into mere self-regard. The indignant fire
in her eyes was quenched, and she began to look at him with timid distress. She
had reproached him for being hurried into irrevocable trespass,&mdash;she, who
had been so weak herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As if I shouldn&rsquo;t feel what happened to you&mdash;just the
same,&rdquo; she said, with reproach of another kind,&mdash;the reproach of
love, asking for more trust. This yielding to the idea of Stephen&rsquo;s
suffering was more fatal than the other yielding, because it was less
distinguishable from that sense of others&rsquo; claims which was the moral
basis of her resistance.
</p>

<p>
He felt all the relenting in her look and tone; it was heaven opening again. He
moved to her side, and took her hand, leaning his elbow on the back of the
boat, and saying nothing. He dreaded to utter another word, he dreaded to make
another movement, that might provoke another reproach or denial from her. Life
hung on her consent; everything else was hopeless, confused, sickening misery.
They glided along in this way, both resting in that silence as in a haven, both
dreading lest their feelings should be divided again,&mdash;till they became
aware that the clouds had gathered, and that the slightest perceptible
freshening of the breeze was growing and growing, so that the whole character
of the day was altered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be chill, Maggie, in this thin dress. Let me raise the cloak
over your shoulders. Get up an instant, dearest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie obeyed; there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to do, and
having everything decided for her. She sat down again covered with the cloak,
and Stephen took to his oars again, making haste; for they must try to get to
Torby as fast as they could. Maggie was hardly conscious of having said or done
anything decisive. All yielding is attended with a less vivid consciousness
than resistance; it is the partial sleep of thought; it is the submergence of
our own personality by another. Every influence tended to lull her into
acquiescence. That dreamy gliding in the boat which had lasted for four hours,
and had brought some weariness and exhaustion; the recoil of her fatigued
sensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the boat at this
unknown distance from home, and walking for long miles,&mdash;all helped to
bring her into more complete subjection to that strong, mysterious charm which
made a last parting from Stephen seem the death of all joy, and made the
thought of wounding him like the first touch of the torturing iron before which
resolution shrank. And then there was the present happiness of being with him,
which was enough to absorb all her languid energy.
</p>

<p>
Presently Stephen observed a vessel coming after them. Several vessels, among
them the steamer to Mudport, had passed them with the early tide, but for the
last hour they had seen none. He looked more and more eagerly at this vessel,
as if a new thought had come into his mind along with it, and then he looked at
Maggie hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie, dearest,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;if this vessel should be
going to Mudport, or to any convenient place on the coast northward, it would
be our best plan to get them to take us on board. You are fatigued, and it may
soon rain; it may be a wretched business, getting to Torby in this boat.
It&rsquo;s only a trading vessel, but I dare say you can be made tolerably
comfortable. We&rsquo;ll take the cushions out of the boat. It is really our
best plan. They&rsquo;ll be glad enough to take us. I&rsquo;ve got plenty of
money about me. I can pay them well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new
proposition; but she was silent,&mdash;one course seemed as difficult as
another.
</p>

<p>
Stephen hailed the vessel. It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport, the English
mate informed him, and, if this wind held, would be there in less than two
days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We had got out too far with our boat,&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;I was
trying to make for Torby. But I&rsquo;m afraid of the weather; and this
lady&mdash;my wife&mdash;will be exhausted with fatigue and hunger. Take us on
board&mdash;will you?&mdash;and haul up the boat. I&rsquo;ll pay you
well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie, now really faint and trembling with fear, was t aken on board, making
an interesting object of contemplation to admiring Dutchmen. The mate feared
the lady would have a poor time of it on board, for they had no accommodation
for such entirely unlooked-for passengers,&mdash;no private cabin larger than
an old-fashioned church-pew. But at least they had Dutch cleanliness, which
makes all other inconveniences tolerable; and the boat cushions were spread
into a couch for Maggie on the poop with all alacrity. But to pace up and down
the deck leaning on Stephen&mdash;being upheld by his strength&mdash;was the
first change that she needed; then came food, and then quiet reclining on the
cushions, with the sense that no new resolution <i>could</i> be taken that day.
Everything must wait till to-morrow. Stephen sat beside her with her hand in
his; they could only speak to each other in low tones; only look at each other
now and then, for it would take a long while to dull the curiosity of the five
men on board, and reduce these handsome young strangers to that minor degree of
interest which belongs, in a sailor&rsquo;s regard, to all objects nearer than
the horizon. But Stephen was triumphantly happy. Every other thought or care
was thrown into unmarked perspective by the certainty that Maggie must be his.
The leap had been taken now; he had been tortured by scruples, he had fought
fiercely with overmastering inclination, he had hesitated; but repentance was
impossible. He murmured forth in fragmentary sentences his happiness, his
adoration, his tenderness, his belief that their life together must be heaven,
that her presence with him would give rapture to every common day; that to
satisfy her lightest wish was dearer to him than all other bliss; that
everything was easy for her sake, except to part with her; and now they never
<i>would</i> part; he would belong to her forever, and all that was his was
hers,&mdash;had no value for him except as it was hers. Such things, uttered in
low, broken tones by the one voice that has first stirred the fibre of young
passion, have only a feeble effect&mdash;on experienced minds at a distance
from them. To poor Maggie they were very near; they were like nectar held close
to thirsty lips; there was, there <i>must</i> be, then, a life for mortals here
below which was not hard and chill,&mdash;in which affection would no longer be
self-sacrifice. Stephen&rsquo;s passionate words made the vision of such a life
more fully present to her than it had ever been before; and the vision for the
time excluded all realities,&mdash;all except the returning sun-gleams which
broke out on the waters as the evening approached, and mingled with the
visionary sunlight of promised happiness; all except the hand that pressed
hers, and the voice that spoke to her, and the eyes that looked at her with
grave, unspeakable love.
</p>

<p>
There was to be no rain, after all; the clouds rolled off to the horizon again,
making the great purple rampart and long purple isles of that wondrous land
which reveals itself to us when the sun goes down,&mdash;the land that the
evening star watches over. Maggie was to sleep all night on the poop; it was
better than going below; and she was covered with the warmest wrappings the
ship could furnish. It was still early, when the fatigues of the day brought on
a drowsy longing for perfect rest, and she laid down her head, looking at the
faint, dying flush in the west, where the one golden lamp was getting brighter
and brighter. Then she looked up at Stephen, who was still seated by her,
hanging over her as he leaned his arm against the vessel&rsquo;s side. Behind
all the delicious visions of these last hours, which had flowed over her like a
soft stream, and made her entirely passive, there was the dim consciousness
that the condition was a transient one, and that the morrow must bring back the
old life of struggle; that there were thoughts which would presently avenge
themselves for this oblivion. But now nothing was distinct to her; she was
being lulled to sleep with that soft stream still flowing over her, with those
delicious visions melting and fading like the wondrous aerial land of the west.

Waking</h3>

<p>
When Maggie was gone to sleep, Stephen, weary too with his unaccustomed amount
of rowing, and with the intense inward life of the last twelve hours, but too
restless to sleep, walked and lounged about the deck with his cigar far on into
midnight, not seeing the dark water, hardly conscious there were stars, living
only in the near and distant future. At last fatigue conquered restlessness,
and he rolled himself up in a piece of tarpaulin on the deck near
Maggie&rsquo;s feet.
</p>

<p>
She had fallen asleep before nine, and had been sleeping for six hours before
the faintest hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible. She awoke from that
vivid dreaming which makes the margin of our deeper rest. She was in a boat on
the wide water with Stephen, and in the gathering darkness something like a
star appeared, that grew and grew till they saw it was the Virgin seated in St
Ogg&rsquo;s boat, and it came nearer and nearer, till they saw the Virgin was
Lucy and the boatman was Philip,&mdash;no, not Philip, but her brother, who
rowed past without looking at her; and she rose to stretch out her arms and
call to him, and their own boat turned over with the movement, and they began
to sink, till with one spasm of dread she seemed to awake, and find she was a
child again in the parlour at evening twilight, and Tom was not really angry.
From the soothed sense of that false waking she passed to the real
waking,&mdash;to the plash of water against the vessel, and the sound of a
footstep on the deck, and the awful starlit sky. There was a moment of utter
bewilderment before her mind could get disentangled from the confused web of
dreams; but soon the whole terrible truth urged itself upon her. Stephen was
not by her now; she was alone with her own memory and her own dread. The
irrevocable wrong that must blot her life had been committed; she had brought
sorrow into the lives of others,&mdash;into the lives that were knit up with
hers by trust and love. The feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her into
the sins her nature had most recoiled from,&mdash;breach of faith and cruel
selfishness; she had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty, and had made
herself an outlawed soul, with no guide but the wayward choice of her own
passion. And where would that lead her? Where had it led her now? She had said
she would rather die than fall into that temptation. She felt it now,&mdash;now
that the consequences of such a fall had come before the outward act was
completed. There was at least this fruit from all her years of striving after
the highest and best,&mdash;that her soul though betrayed, beguiled, ensnared,
could never deliberately consent to a choice of the lower. And a choice of
what? O God! not a choice of joy, but of conscious cruelty and hardness; for
could she ever cease to see before her Lucy and Philip, with their murdered
trust and hopes? Her life with Stephen could have no sacredness; she must
forever sink and wander vaguely, driven by uncertain impulse; for she had let
go the clue of life,&mdash;that clue which once in the far-off years her young
need had clutched so strongly. She had renounced all delights then, before she
knew them, before they had come within her reach. Philip had been right when he
told her that she knew nothing of renunciation; she had thought it was quiet
ecstasy; she saw it face to face now,&mdash;that sad, patient, loving strength
which holds the clue of life,&mdash;and saw that the thorns were forever
pressing on its brow. The yesterday, which could never be revoked,&mdash;if she
could have changed it now for any length of inward silent endurance, she would
have bowed beneath that cross with a sense of rest.
</p>

<p>
Day break came and the reddening eastern light, while her past life was
grasping her in this way, with that tightening clutch which comes in the last
moments of possible rescue. She could see Stephen now lying on the deck still
fast asleep, and with the sight of him there came a wave of anguish that found
its way in a long-suppressed sob. The worst bitterness of parting&mdash;the
thought that urged the sharpest inward cry for help&mdash;was the pain it must
give to <i>him</i>. But surmounting everything was the horror at her own
possible failure, the dread lest her conscience should be benumbed again, and
not rise to energy till it was too late. Too late! it was too late already not
to have caused misery; too late for everything, perhaps, but to rush away from
the last act of baseness,&mdash;the tasting of joys that were wrung from
crushed hearts.
</p>

<p>
The sun was rising now, and Maggie started up with the sense that a day of
resistance was beginning for her. Her eyelashes were still wet with tears, as,
with her shawl over her head, she sat looking at the slowly rounding sun.
Something roused Stephen too, and getting up from his hard bed, he came to sit
beside her. The sharp instinct of anxious love saw something to give him alarm
in the very first glance. He had a hovering dread of some resistance in
Maggie&rsquo;s nature that he would be unable to overcome. He had the uneasy
consciousness that he had robbed her of perfect freedom yesterday; there was
too much native honour in him, for him not to feel that, if her will should
recoil, his conduct would have been odious, and she would have a right to
reproach him.
</p>

<p>
But Maggie did not feel that right; she was too conscious of fatal weakness in
herself, too full of the tenderness that comes with the foreseen need for
inflicting a wound. She let him take her hand when he came to sit down beside
her, and smiled at him, only with rather a sad glance; she could say nothing to
pain him till the moment of possible parting was nearer. And so they drank
their cup of coffee together, and walked about the deck, and heard the
captain&rsquo;s assurance that they should be in at Mudport by five
o&rsquo;clock, each with an inward burthen; but in him it was an undefined
fear, which he trusted to the coming hours to dissipate; in her it was a
definite resolve on which she was trying silently to tighten her hold. Stephen
was continually, through the morning, expressing his anxiety at the fatigue and
discomfort she was suffering, and alluded to landing and to the change of
motion and repose she would have in a carriage, wanting to assure himself more
completely by presupposing that everything would be as he had arranged it. For
a long while Maggie contented herself with assuring him that she had had a good
night&rsquo;s rest, and that she didn&rsquo;t mind about being on the
vessel,&mdash;it was not like being on the open sea, it was only a little less
pleasant than being in a boat on the Floss. But a suppressed resolve will
betray itself in the eyes, and Stephen became more and more uneasy as the day
advanced, under the sense that Maggie had entirely lost her passiveness. He
longed, but did not dare, to speak of their marriage, of where they would go
after it, and the steps he would take to inform his father, and the rest, of
what had happened. He longed to assure himself of a tacit assent from her. But
each time he looked at her, he gathered a stronger dread of the new, quiet
sadness with which she met his eyes. And they were more and more silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here we are in sight of Mudport,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Now,
dearest,&rdquo; he added, turning toward her with a look that was half
beseeching, &ldquo;the worst part of your fatigue is over. On the land we can
command swiftness. In another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise together,
and that will seem rest to you after this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie felt it was time to speak; it would only be unkind now to assent by
silence. She spoke in the lowest tone, as he had done, but with distinct
decision.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall not be together; we shall have parted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The blood rushed to Stephen&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was as he had dreaded&mdash;there was a struggle coming. But neither of them
dared to say another word till the boat was let down, and they were taken to
the landing-place. Here there was a cluster of gazers and passengers awaiting
the departure of the steamboat to St Ogg&rsquo;s. Maggie had a dim sense, when
she had landed, and Stephen was hurrying her along on his arm, that some one
had advanced toward her from that cluster as if he were coming to speak to her.
But she was hurried along, and was indifferent to everything but the coming
trial.
</p>

<p>
A porter guided them to the nearest inn and posting-house, and Stephen gave the
order for the chaise as they passed through the yard. Maggie took no notice of
this, and only said, &ldquo;Ask them to show us into a room where we can sit
down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they entered, Maggie did not sit down, and Stephen, whose face had a
desperate determination in it, was about to ring the bell, when she said, in a
firm voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going; we must part here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; he said, turning round toward her, and speaking in the
tones of a man who feels a process of torture beginning, &ldquo;do you mean to
kill me? What is the use of it now? The whole thing is done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it is not done,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;Too much is
done,&mdash;more than we can ever remove the trace of. But I will go no
farther. Don&rsquo;t try to prevail with me again. I couldn&rsquo;t choose
yesterday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What was he to do? He dared not go near her; her anger might leap out, and make
a new barrier. He walked backward and forward in maddening perplexity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; he said at last, pausing before her, and speaking in a
tone of imploring wretchedness, &ldquo;have some pity&mdash;hear
me&mdash;forgive me for what I did yesterday. I will obey you now; I will do
nothing without your full consent. But don&rsquo;t blight our lives forever by
a rash perversity that can answer no good purpose to any one, that can only
create new evils. Sit down, dearest; wait&mdash;think what you are going to do.
Don&rsquo;t treat me as if you couldn&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had chosen the most effective appeal; but Maggie&rsquo;s will was fixed
unswervingly on the coming wrench. She had made up her mind to suffer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must not wait,&rdquo; she said, in a low but distinct voice;
&ldquo;we must part at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We <i>can&rsquo;t</i> part, Maggie,&rdquo; said Stephen, more
impetuously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it. What is the use of inflicting that
misery on me? The blow&mdash;whatever it may have been&mdash;has been struck
now. Will it help any one else that you should drive me mad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will not begin any future, even for you,&rdquo; said Maggie,
tremulously, &ldquo;with a deliberate consent to what ought not to have been.
What I told you at Basset I feel now; I would rather have died than fall into
this temptation. It would have been better if we had parted forever then. But
we must part now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will <i>not</i> part,&rdquo; Stephen burst out, instinctively placing
his back against the door, forgetting everything he had said a few moments
before; &ldquo;I will not endure it. You&rsquo;ll make me desperate; I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know what I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie trembled. She felt that the parting could not be effected suddenly. She
must rely on a slower appeal to Stephen&rsquo;s better self; she must be
prepared for a harder task than that of rushing away while resolution was
fresh. She sat down. Stephen, watching her with that look of desperation which
had come over him like a lurid light, approached slowly from the door, seated
himself close beside her, and grasped her hand. Her heart beat like the heart
of a frightened bird; but this direct opposition helped her. She felt her
determination growing stronger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember what you felt weeks ago,&rdquo; she began, with beseeching
earnestness; &ldquo;remember what we both felt,&mdash;that we owed ourselves to
others, and must conquer every inclination which could make us false to that
debt. We have failed to keep our resolutions; but the wrong remains the
same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it does <i>not</i> remain the same,&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;We
have proved that it was impossible to keep our resolutions. We have proved that
the feeling which draws us toward each other is too strong to be overcome. That
natural law surmounts every other; we can&rsquo;t help what it clashes
with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not so, Stephen; I&rsquo;m quite sure that is wrong. I have tried
to think it again and again; but I see, if we judged in that way, there would
be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty; we should justify breaking the most
sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth. If the past is not to bind us,
where can duty lie? We should have no law but the inclination of the
moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there are ties that can&rsquo;t be kept by mere resolution,&rdquo;
said Stephen, starting up and walking about again. &ldquo;What is outward
faithfulness? Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as constancy
without love?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie did not answer immediately. She was undergoing an inward as well as an
outward contest. At last she said, with a passionate assertion of her
conviction, as much against herself as against him,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That seems right&mdash;at first; but when I look further, I&rsquo;m sure
it is <i>not</i> right. Faithfulness and constancy mean something else besides
doing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves. They mean renouncing
whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in us,&mdash;whatever would
cause misery to those whom the course of our lives has made dependent on us. If
we&mdash;if I had been better, nobler, those claims would have been so strongly
present with me,&mdash;I should have felt them pressing on my heart so
continually, just as they do now in the moments when my conscience is
awake,&mdash;that the opposite feeling would never have grown in me, as it has
done; it would have been quenched at once, I should have prayed for help so
earnestly, I should have rushed away as we rush from hideous danger. I feel no
excuse for myself, none. I should never have failed toward Lucy and Philip as I
have done, if I had not been weak, selfish, and hard,&mdash;able to think of
their pain without a pain to myself that would have destroyed all temptation.
Oh, what is Lucy feeling now? She believed in me&mdash;she loved me&mdash;she
was so good to me. Think of her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s voice was getting choked as she uttered these last words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> think of her,&rdquo; said Stephen, stamping as if
with pain. &ldquo;I can think of nothing but you, Maggie. You demand of a man
what is impossible. I felt that once; but I can&rsquo;t go back to it now. And
where is the use of <i>your</i> thinking of it, except to torture me? You
can&rsquo;t save them from pain now; you can only tear yourself from me, and
make my life worthless to me. And even if we could go back, and both fulfil our
engagements,&mdash;if that were possible now,&mdash;it would be hateful,
horrible, to think of your ever being Philip&rsquo;s wife,&mdash;of your ever
being the wife of a man you didn&rsquo;t love. We have both been rescued from a
mistake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A deep flush came over Maggie&rsquo;s face, and she couldn&rsquo;t speak.
Stephen saw this. He sat down again, taking her hand in his, and looking at her
with passionate entreaty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie! Dearest! If you love me, you are mine. Who can have so great a
claim on you as I have? My life is bound up in your love. There is nothing in
the past that can annul our right to each other; it is the first time we have
either of us loved with our whole heart and soul.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was still silent for a little while, looking down. Stephen was in a
flutter of new hope; he was going to triumph. But she raised her eyes and met
his with a glance that was filled with the anguish of regret, not with
yielding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not with my whole heart and soul, Stephen,&rdquo; she said with
timid resolution. &ldquo;I have never consented to it with my whole mind. There
are memories, and affections, and longings after perfect goodness, that have
such a strong hold on me; they would never quit me for long; they would come
back and be pain to me&mdash;repentance. I couldn&rsquo;t live in peace if I
put the shadow of a wilful sin between myself and God. I have caused sorrow
already&mdash;I know&mdash;I feel it; but I have never deliberately consented
to it; I have never said, &lsquo;They shall suffer, that I may have joy.&rsquo;
It has never been my will to marry you; if you were to win consent from the
momentary triumph of my feeling for you, you would not have my whole soul. If I
could wake back again into the time before yesterday, I would choose to be true
to my calmer affections, and live without the joy of love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen loosed her hand, and rising impatiently, walked up and down the room in
suppressed rage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he burst out at last, &ldquo;what a miserable thing a
woman&rsquo;s love is to a man&rsquo;s! I could commit crimes for
you,&mdash;and you can balance and choose in that way. But you
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> love me; if you had a tithe of the feeling for me that I
have for you, it would be impossible to you to think for a moment of
sacrificing me. But it weighs nothing with you that you are robbing me of
<i>my</i> life&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie pressed her fingers together almost convulsively as she held them
clasped on her lap. A great terror was upon her, as if she were ever and anon
seeing where she stood by great flashes of lightning, and then again stretched
forth her hands in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t sacrifice you&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t sacrifice
you,&rdquo; she said, as soon as she could speak again; &ldquo;but I
can&rsquo;t believe in a good for you, that I feel, that we both feel, is a
wrong toward others. We can&rsquo;t choose happiness either for ourselves or
for another; we can&rsquo;t tell where that will lie. We can only choose
whether we will indulge ourselves in the present moment, or whether we will
renounce that, for the sake of obeying the divine voice within us,&mdash;for
the sake of being true to all the motives that sanctify our lives. I know this
belief is hard; it has slipped away from me again and again; but I have felt
that if I let it go forever, I should have no light through the darkness of
this life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Maggie,&rdquo; said Stephen, seating himself by her again,
&ldquo;is it possible you don&rsquo;t see that what happened yesterday has
altered the whole position of things? What infatuation is it, what obstinate
prepossession, that blinds you to that? It is too late to say what we might
have done or what we ought to have done. Admitting the very worst view of what
has been done, it is a fact we must act on now; our position is altered; the
right course is no longer what it was before. We must accept our own actions
and start afresh from them. Suppose we had been married yesterday? It is nearly
the same thing. The effect on others would not have been different. It would
only have made this difference to ourselves,&rdquo; Stephen added bitterly,
&ldquo;that you might have acknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger
than to others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again a deep flush came over Maggie&rsquo;s face, and she was silent. Stephen
thought again that he was beginning to prevail,&mdash;he had never yet believed
that he should <i>not</i> prevail; there are possibilities which our minds
shrink from too completely for us to fear them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he said, in his deepest, tenderest tone, leaning toward
her, and putting his arm round her, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> mine now,&mdash;the
world believes it; duty must spring out of that now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a few hours you will be legally mine, and those who had claims on us
will submit,&mdash;they will see that there was a force which declared against
their claims.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was
close to hers, and she started up, pale again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she said, in a voice almost of agony;
&ldquo;Stephen, don&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;don&rsquo;t urge me. I can&rsquo;t
argue any longer,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what is wise; but my heart will not
let me do it. I see,&mdash;I feel their trouble now; it is as if it were
branded on my mind. <i>I</i> have suffered, and had no one to pity me; and now
I have made others suffer. It would never leave me; it would embitter your love
to me. I <i>do</i> care for Philip&mdash;in a different way; I remember all we
said to each other; I know how he thought of me as the one promise of his life.
He was given to me that I might make his lot less hard; and I have forsaken
him. And Lucy&mdash;she has been deceived; she who trusted me more than any
one. I cannot marry you; I cannot take a good for myself that has been wrung
out of their misery. It is not the force that ought to rule us,&mdash;this that
we feel for each other; it would rend me away from all that my past life has
made dear and holy to me. I can&rsquo;t set out on a fresh life, and forget
that; I must go back to it, and cling to it, else I shall feel as if there were
nothing firm beneath my feet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good God, Maggie!&rdquo; said Stephen, rising too and grasping her arm,
&ldquo;you rave. How can you go back without marrying me? You don&rsquo;t know
what will be said, dearest. You see nothing as it really is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I do. But they will believe me. I will confess everything. Lucy
will believe me&mdash;she will forgive you, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, <i>some</i>
good will come by clinging to the right. Dear, dear Stephen, let me
go!&mdash;don&rsquo;t drag me into deeper remorse. My whole soul has never
consented; it does not consent now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stephen let go her arm, and sank back on his chair, half-stunned by despairing
rage. He was silent a few moments, not looking at her; while her eyes were
turned toward him yearningly, in alarm at this sudden change. At last he said,
still without looking at her,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go, then,&mdash;leave me; don&rsquo;t torture me any longer,&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily she leaned toward him and put out her hand to touch his. But he
shrank from it as if it had been burning iron, and said again,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was not conscious of a decision as she turned away from that gloomy
averted face, and walked out of the room; it was like an automatic action that
fulfils a forgotten intention. What came after? A sense of stairs descended as
if in a dream, of flagstones, of a chaise and horses standing, then a street,
and a turning into another street where a stage-coach was standing, taking in
passengers, and the darting thought that that coach would take her away,
perhaps toward home. But she could ask nothing yet; she only got into the
coach.
</p>

<p>
Home&mdash;where her mother and brother were, Philip, Lucy, the scene of her
very cares and trials&mdash;was the haven toward which her mind tended; the
sanctuary where sacred relics lay, where she would be rescued from more
falling. The thought of Stephen was like a horrible throbbing pain, which yet,
as such pains do, seemed to urge all other thoughts into activity. But among
her thoughts, what others would say and think of her conduct was hardly
present. Love and deep pity and remorseful anguish left no room for that.
</p>

<p>
The coach was taking her to York, farther away from home; but she did not learn
that until she was set down in the old city at midnight. It was no matter; she
could sleep there, and start home the next day. She had her purse in her
pocket, with all her money in it,&mdash;a bank-note and a sovereign; she had
kept it in her pocket from forgetfulness, after going out to make purchases the
day before yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Did she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with her will
bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice? The great struggles of
life are not so easy as that; the great problems of life are not so clear. In
the darkness of that night she saw Stephen&rsquo;s face turned toward her in
passionate, reproachful misery; she lived through again all the tremulous
delights of his presence with her that made existence an easy floating in a
stream of joy, instead of a quiet resolved endurance and effort. The love she
had renounced came back upon her with a cruel charm; she felt herself opening
her arms to receive it once more; and then it seemed to slip away and fade and
vanish, leaving only the dying sound of a deep, thrilling voice that said,
&ldquo;Gone, forever gone.&rdquo;

The Return to the Mill</h3>

<p>
Between four and five o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of the fifth day from that
on which Stephen and Maggie had left St Ogg&rsquo;s, Tom Tulliver was standing
on the gravel walk outside the old house at Dorlcote Mill. He was master there
now; he had half fulfilled his father&rsquo;s dying wish, and by years of
steady self-government and energetic work he had brought himself near to the
attainment of more than the old respectability which had been the proud
inheritance of the Dodsons and Tullivers.
</p>

<p>
But Tom&rsquo;s face, as he stood in the hot, still sunshine of that summer
afternoon, had no gladness, no triumph in it. His mouth wore its bitterest
expression, his severe brow its hardest and deepest fold, as he drew down his
hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the sun, and thrusting his hands
deep into his pockets, began to walk up and down the gravel. No news of his
sister had been heard since Bob Jakin had come back in the steamer from
Mudport, and put an end to all improbable suppositions of an accident on the
water by stating that he had seen her land from a vessel with Mr Stephen
Guest. Would the next news be that she was married,&mdash;or what? Probably
that she was not married; Tom&rsquo;s mind was set to the expectation of the
worst that could happen,&mdash;not death, but disgrace.
</p>

<p>
As he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate, and his face toward
the rushing mill-stream, a tall, dark-eyed figure, that we know well,
approached the gate, and paused to look at him with a fast-beating heart. Her
brother was the human being of whom she had been most afraid from her childhood
upward; afraid with that fear which springs in us when we love one who is
inexorable, unbending, unmodifiable, with a mind that we can never mould
ourselves upon, and yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us.
</p>

<p>
That deep-rooted fear was shaking Maggie now; but her mind was unswervingly
bent on returning to her brother, as the natural refuge that had been given
her. In her deep humiliation under the retrospect of her own weakness,&mdash;in
her anguish at the injury she had inflicted,&mdash;she almost desired to endure
the severity of Tom&rsquo;s reproof, to submit in patient silence to that
harsh, disapproving judgment against which she had so often rebelled; it seemed
no more than just to her now,&mdash;who was weaker than she was? She craved
that outward help to her better purpose which would come from complete,
submissive confession; from being in the presence of those whose looks and
words would be a reflection of her own conscience.
</p>

<p>
Maggie had been kept on her bed at York for a day with that prostrating
headache which was likely to follow on the terrible strain of the previous day
and night. There was an expression of physical pain still about her brow and
eyes, and her whole appearance, with her dress so long unchanged, was worn and
distressed. She lifted the latch of the gate and walked in slowly. Tom did not
hear the gate; he was just then close upon the roaring dam; but he presently
turned, and lifting up his eyes, saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness
seemed to him a confirmation of his worst conjectures. He paused, trembling and
white with disgust and indignation.
</p>

<p>
Maggie paused too, three yards before him. She felt the hatred in his face,
felt it rushing through her fibres; but she must speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she began faintly, &ldquo;I am come back to you,&mdash;I am
come back home&mdash;for refuge&mdash;to tell you everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will find no home with me,&rdquo; he answered, with tremulous rage.
&ldquo;You have disgraced us all. You have disgraced my father&rsquo;s name.
You have been a curse to your best friends. You have been base, deceitful; no
motives are strong enough to restrain you. I wash my hands of you forever. You
don&rsquo;t belong to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Their mother had come to the door now. She stood paralyzed by the double shock
of seeing Maggie and hearing Tom&rsquo;s words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Maggie, with more courage, &ldquo;I am perhaps not so
guilty as you believe me to be. I never meant to give way to my feelings. I
struggled against them. I was carried too far in the boat to come back on
Tuesday. I came back as soon as I could.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe in you any more,&rdquo; said Tom, gradually
passing from the tremulous excitement of the first moment to cold
inflexibility. &ldquo;You have been carrying on a clandestine relation with
Stephen Guest,&mdash;as you did before with another. He went to see you at my
aunt Moss&rsquo;s; you walked alone with him in the lanes; you must have
behaved as no modest girl would have done to her cousin&rsquo;s lover, else
that could never have happened. The people at Luckreth saw you pass; you passed
all the other places; you knew what you were doing. You have been using Philip
Wakem as a screen to deceive Lucy,&mdash;the kindest friend you ever had. Go
and see the return you have made her. She&rsquo;s ill; unable to speak. My
mother can&rsquo;t go near her, lest she should remind her of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was half stunned,&mdash;too heavily pressed upon by her anguish even to
discern any difference between her actual guilt and her brother&rsquo;s
accusations, still less to vindicate herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said, crushing her hands together under her cloak, in
the effort to speak again, &ldquo;whatever I have done, I repent it bitterly. I
want to make amends. I will endure anything. I want to be kept from doing wrong
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What <i>will</i> keep you?&rdquo; said Tom, with cruel bitterness.
&ldquo;Not religion; not your natural feelings of gratitude and honour. And
he&mdash;he would deserve to be shot, if it were not&mdash;&mdash;But you are
ten times worse than he is. I loathe your character and your conduct. You
struggled with your feelings, you say. Yes! <i>I</i> have had feelings to
struggle with; but I conquered them. I have had a harder life than you have
had; but I have found <i>my</i> comfort in doing my duty. But I will sanction
no such character as yours; the world shall know that <i>I</i> feel the
difference between right and wrong. If you are in want, I will provide for you;
let my mother know. But you shall not come under my roof. It is enough that I
have to bear the thought of your disgrace; the sight of you is hateful to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Slowly Maggie was turning away with despair in her heart. But the poor
frightened mother&rsquo;s love leaped out now, stronger than all dread.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My child! I&rsquo;ll go with you. You&rsquo;ve got a mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh, the sweet rest of that embrace to the heart-stricken Maggie! More helpful
than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will not forsake us.
</p>

<p>
Tom turned and walked into the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in, my child,&rdquo; Mrs Tulliver whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
let you stay and sleep in my bed. He won&rsquo;t deny that if I ask him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said Maggie, in a low tone, like a moan. &ldquo;I
will never go in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then wait for me outside. I&rsquo;ll get ready and come with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When his mother appeared with her bonnet on, Tom came out to her in the
passage, and put money into her hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My house is yours, mother, always,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will come
and let me know everything you want; you will come back to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor Mrs Tulliver took the money, too frightened to say anything. The only
thing clear to her was the mother&rsquo;s instinct that she would go with her
unhappy child.
</p>

<p>
Maggie was waiting outside the gate; she took her mother&rsquo;s hand and they
walked a little way in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Maggie, at last, &ldquo;we will go to Luke&rsquo;s
cottage. Luke will take me in. He was very good to me when I was a little
girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got no room for us, my dear, now; his wife&rsquo;s got so
many children. I don&rsquo;t know where to go, if it isn&rsquo;t to one
o&rsquo; your aunts; and I hardly durst,&rdquo; said poor Mrs Tulliver, quite
destitute of mental resources in this extremity.
</p>

<p>
Maggie was silent a little while, and then said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go to Bob Jakin&rsquo;s, mother; his wife will have room for us,
if they have no other lodger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So they went on their way to St Ogg&rsquo;s, to the old house by the
river-side.
</p>

<p>
Bob himself was at home, with a heaviness at heart which resisted even the new
joy and pride of possessing a two-months&rsquo;-old baby, quite the liveliest
of its age that had ever been born to prince or packman. He would perhaps not
so thoroughly have understood all the dubiousness of Maggie&rsquo;s appearance
with Mr Stephen Guest on the quay at Mudport if he had not witnessed the
effect it produced on Tom when he went to report it; and since then, the
circumstances which in any case gave a disastrous character to her elopement
had passed beyond the more polite circles of St Ogg&rsquo;s, and had become
matter of common talk, accessible to the grooms and errand-boys. So that when
he opened the door and saw Maggie standing before him in her sorrow and
weariness, he had no questions to ask except one which he dared only ask
himself,&mdash;where was Mr Stephen Guest? Bob, for his part, hoped he might
be in the warmest department of an asylum understood to exist in the other
world for gentlemen who are likely to be in fallen circumstances there.
</p>

<p>
The lodgings were vacant, and both Mrs Jakin the larger and Mrs Jakin the
less were commanded to make all things comfortable for &ldquo;the old Missis
and the young Miss&rdquo;; alas that she was still &ldquo;Miss!&rdquo; The
ingenious Bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have come about;
how Mr Stephen Guest could have gone away from her, or could have let her go
away from him, when he had the chance of keeping her with him. But he was
silent, and would not allow his wife to ask him a question; would not present
himself in the room, lest it should appear like intrusion and a wish to pry;
having the same chivalry toward dark-eyed Maggie as in the days when he had
bought her the memorable present of books.
</p>

<p>
But after a day or two Mrs Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a few hours
to see to Tom&rsquo;s household matters. Maggie had wished this; after the
first violent outburst of feeling which came as soon as she had no longer any
active purpose to fulfil, she was less in need of her mother&rsquo;s presence;
she even desired to be alone with her grief. But she had been solitary only a
little while in the old sitting-room that looked on the river, when there came
a tap at the door, and turning round her sad face as she said &ldquo;Come
in,&rdquo; she saw Bob enter, with the baby in his arms and Mumps at his heels.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back, if it disturbs you, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maggie, in a low voice, wishing she could smile.
</p>

<p>
Bob, closing the door behind him, came and stood before her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;ve got a little un, Miss, and I want&rsquo;d you to
look at it, and take it in your arms, if you&rsquo;d be so good. For we made
free to name it after you, and it &rsquo;ud be better for your takin&rsquo; a
bit o&rsquo; notice on it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie could not speak, but she put out her arms to receive the tiny baby,
while Mumps snuffed at it anxiously, to ascertain that this transference was
all right. Maggie&rsquo;s heart had swelled at this action and speech of
Bob&rsquo;s; she knew well enough that it was a way he had chosen to show his
sympathy and respect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down, Bob,&rdquo; she said presently, and he sat down in silence,
finding his tongue unmanageable in quite a new fashion, refusing to say what he
wanted it to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she said, after a few moments, looking down at the baby, and
holding it anxiously, as if she feared it might slip from her mind and her
fingers, &ldquo;I have a favour to ask of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you speak so, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob, grasping the skin of
Mumps&rsquo;s neck; &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s anything I can do for you, I should
look upon it as a day&rsquo;s earnings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you to go to Dr Kenn&rsquo;s, and ask to speak to him, and tell
him that I am here, and should be very grateful if he would come to me while my
mother is away. She will not come back till evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Miss, I&rsquo;d do it in a minute,&mdash;it is but a step,&mdash;but
Dr Kenn&rsquo;s wife lies dead; she&rsquo;s to be buried to-morrow; died the
day I come from Mudport. It&rsquo;s all the more pity she should ha&rsquo; died
just now, if you want him. I hardly like to go a-nigh him yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, Bob,&rdquo; said Maggie, &ldquo;we must let it be,&mdash;till
after a few days, perhaps, when you hear that he is going about again. But
perhaps he may be going out of town&mdash;to a distance,&rdquo; she added, with
a new sense of despondency at this idea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not he, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;ll</i> none go away.
He isn&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; them gentlefolks as go to cry at
waterin&rsquo;-places when their wives die; he&rsquo;s got summat else to do.
He looks fine and sharp after the parish, he does. He christened the little un;
an&rsquo; he was <i>at</i> me to know what I did of a Sunday, as I didn&rsquo;t
come to church. But I told him I was upo&rsquo; the travel three parts o&rsquo;
the Sundays,&mdash;an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;m so used to bein&rsquo; on my legs,
I can&rsquo;t sit so long on end,&mdash;&lsquo;an&rsquo; lors, sir,&rsquo; says
I, &lsquo;a packman can do wi&rsquo; a small &rsquo;lowance o&rsquo; church; it
tastes strong,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no call to lay it on
thick.&rsquo; Eh, Miss, how good the little un is wi&rsquo; you! It&rsquo;s
like as if it knowed you; it partly does, I&rsquo;ll be bound,&mdash;like the
birds know the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bob&rsquo;s tongue was now evidently loosed from its unwonted bondage, and
might even be in danger of doing more work than was required of it. But the
subjects on which he longed to be informed were so steep and difficult of
approach, that his tongue was likely to run on along the level rather than to
carry him on that unbeaten road. He felt this, and was silent again for a
little while, ruminating much on the possible forms in which he might put a
question. At last he said, in a more timid voice than usual,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you give me leave to ask you only one thing, Miss?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie was rather startled, but she answered, &ldquo;Yes, Bob, if it is about
myself&mdash;not about any one else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Miss, it&rsquo;s this. <i>Do</i> you owe anybody a grudge?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not any one,&rdquo; said Maggie, looking up at him inquiringly.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, lors, Miss,&rdquo; said Bob, pinching Mumps&rsquo;s neck harder than
ever. &ldquo;I wish you did, an&rsquo; tell me; I&rsquo;d leather him till I
couldn&rsquo;t see&mdash;I would&mdash;an&rsquo; the Justice might do what he
liked to me arter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Bob,&rdquo; said Maggie, smiling faintly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a very
good friend to me. But I shouldn&rsquo;t like to punish any one, even if
they&rsquo;d done me wrong; I&rsquo;ve done wrong myself too often.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This view of things was puzzling to Bob, and threw more obscurity than ever
over what could possibly have happened between Stephen and Maggie. But further
questions would have been too intrusive, even if he could have framed them
suitably, and he was obliged to carry baby away again to an expectant mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Happen you&rsquo;d like Mumps for company, Miss,&rdquo; he said when he
had taken the baby again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rare company, Mumps is; he knows
iverything, an&rsquo; makes no bother about it. If I tell him, he&rsquo;ll lie
before you an&rsquo; watch you, as still,&mdash;just as he watches my pack.
You&rsquo;d better let me leave him a bit; he&rsquo;ll get fond on you. Lors,
it&rsquo;s a fine thing to hev a dumb brute fond on you; it&rsquo;ll stick to
you, an&rsquo; make no jaw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, do leave him, please,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;I think I should
like to have Mumps for a friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mumps, lie down there,&rdquo; said Bob, pointing to a place in front of
Maggie, &ldquo;and niver do you stir till you&rsquo;re spoke to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mumps lay down at once, and made no sign of restlessness when his master left
the room.

<h3><a name="chap55"></a>Chapter II.<br/>
St Ogg&rsquo;s Passes Judgment</h3>

<p>
It was soon known throughout St Ogg&rsquo;s that Miss Tulliver was come back;
she had not, then, eloped in order to be married to Mr Stephen Guest,&mdash;at
all events, Mr Stephen Guest had not married her; which came to the same
thing, so far as her culpability was concerned. We judge others according to
results; how else?&mdash;not knowing the process by which results are arrived
at. If Miss Tulliver, after a few months of well-chosen travel, had returned as
Mrs Stephen Guest, with a post-marital <i>trousseau</i>, and all the
advantages possessed even by the most unwelcome wife of an only son, public
opinion, which at St Ogg&rsquo;s, as else where, always knew what to think,
would have judged in strict consistency with those results. Public opinion, in
these cases, is always of the feminine gender,&mdash;not the world, but the
world&rsquo;s wife; and she would have seen that two handsome young
people&mdash;the gentleman of quite the first family in St
Ogg&rsquo;s&mdash;having found themselves in a false position, had been led
into a course which, to say the least of it, was highly injudicious, and
productive of sad pain and disappointment, especially to that sweet young
thing, Miss Deane. Mr Stephen Guest had certainly not behaved well; but then,
young men were liable to those sudden infatuated attachments; and bad as it
might seem in Mrs Stephen Guest to admit the faintest advances from her
cousin&rsquo;s lover (indeed it <i>had</i> been said that she was actually
engaged to young Wakem,&mdash;old Wakem himself had mentioned it), still, she
was very young,&mdash;&ldquo;and a deformed young man, you know!&mdash;and
young Guest so very fascinating; and, they say, he positively worships her (to
be sure, that can&rsquo;t last!), and he ran away with her in the boat quite
against her will, and what could she do? She couldn&rsquo;t come back then; no
one would have spoken to her; and how very well that maize-coloured satinette
becomes her complexion! It seems as if the folds in front were quite come in;
several of her dresses are made so,&mdash;they say he thinks nothing too
handsome to buy for her. Poor Miss Deane! She is very pitiable; but then there
was no positive engagement; and the air at the coast will do her good. After
all, if young Guest felt no more for her than <i>that</i> it was better for her
not to marry him. What a wonderful marriage for a girl like Miss
Tulliver,&mdash;quite romantic? Why, young Guest will put up for the borough at
the next election. Nothing like commerce nowadays! That young Wakem nearly went
out of his mind; he always <i>was</i> rather queer; but he&rsquo;s gone abroad
again to be out of the way,&mdash;quite the best thing for a deformed young
man. Miss Unit declares she will never visit Mr and Mrs Stephen
Guest,&mdash;such nonsense! pretending to be better than other people. Society
couldn&rsquo;t be carried on if we inquired into private conduct in that
way,&mdash;and Christianity tells us to think no evil,&mdash;and my belief is,
that Miss Unit had no cards sent her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the results, we know, were not of a kind to warrant this extenuation of the
past. Maggie had returned without a <i>trousseau</i>, without a
husband,&mdash;in that degraded and outcast condition to which error is well
known to lead; and the world&rsquo;s wife, with that fine instinct which is
given her for the preservation of Society, saw at once that Miss
Tulliver&rsquo;s conduct had been of the most aggravated kind. Could anything
be more detestable? A girl so much indebted to her friends&mdash;whose mother
as well as herself had received so much kindness from the Deanes&mdash;to lay
the design of winning a young man&rsquo;s affections away from her own cousin,
who had behaved like a sister to her! Winning his affections? That was not the
phrase for such a girl as Miss Tulliver; it would have been more correct to say
that she had been actuated by mere unwomanly boldness and unbridled passion.
There was always something questionable about her. That connection with young
Wakem, which, they said, had been carried on for years, looked very
ill,&mdash;disgusting, in fact! But with a girl of that disposition! To the
world&rsquo;s wife there had always been something in Miss Tulliver&rsquo;s
very <i>physique</i> that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm. As
for poor Mr Stephen Guest, he was rather pitiable than otherwise; a young man
of five-and-twenty is not to be too severely judged in these cases,&mdash;he is
really very much at the mercy of a designing, bold girl. And it was clear that
he had given way in spite of himself: he had shaken her off as soon as he
could; indeed, their having parted so soon looked very black
indeed&mdash;<i>for her</i>. To be sure, he had written a letter, laying all
the blame on himself, and telling the story in a romantic fashion so as to try
and make her appear quite innocent; of course he would do that! But the refined
instinct of the world&rsquo;s wife was not to be deceived;
providentially!&mdash;else what would become of Society? Why, her own brother
had turned her from his door; he had seen enough, you might be sure, before he
would do that. A truly respectable young man, Mr Tom Tulliver; quite likely to
rise in the world! His sister&rsquo;s disgrace was naturally a heavy blow to
him. It was to be hoped that she would go out of the neighbourhood,&mdash;to
America, or anywhere,&mdash;so as to purify the air of St Ogg&rsquo;s from the
stain of her presence, extremely dangerous to daughters there! No good could
happen to her; it was only to be hoped she would repent, and that God would
have mercy on her: He had not the care of society on His hands, as the
world&rsquo;s wife had.
</p>

<p>
It required nearly a fortnight for fine instinct to assure itself of these
inspirations; indeed, it was a whole week before Stephen&rsquo;s letter came,
telling his father the facts, and adding that he was gone across to
Holland,&mdash;had drawn upon the agent at Mudport for money,&mdash;was
incapable of any resolution at present.
</p>

<p>
Maggie, all this while, was too entirely filled with a more agonizing anxiety
to spend any thought on the view that was being taken of her conduct by the
world of St Ogg&rsquo;s; anxiety about Stephen, Lucy, Philip, beat on her poor
heart in a hard, driving, ceaseless storm of mingled love, remorse, and pity.
If she had thought of rejection and injustice at all, it would have seemed to
her that they had done their worst; that she could hardly feel any stroke from
them intolerable since the words she had heard from her brother&rsquo;s lips.
Across all her anxiety for the loved and the injured, those words shot again
and again, like a horrible pang that would have brought misery and dread even
into a heaven of delights. The idea of ever recovering happiness never
glimmered in her mind for a moment; it seemed as if every sensitive fibre in
her were too entirely preoccupied by pain ever to vibrate again to another
influence. Life stretched before her as one act of penitence; and all she
craved, as she dwelt on her future lot, was something to guarantee her from
more falling; her own weakness haunted her like a vision of hideous
possibilities, that made no peace conceivable except such as lay in the sense
of a sure refuge.
</p>

<p>
But she was not without practical intentions; the love of independence was too
strong an inheritance and a habit for her not to remember that she must get her
bread; and when other projects looked vague, she fell back on that of returning
to her plain sewing, and so getting enough to pay for her lodging at
Bob&rsquo;s. She meant to persuade her mother to return to the Mill by and by,
and live with Tom again; and somehow or other she would maintain herself at St
Ogg&rsquo;s. Dr Kenn would perhaps help her and advise her. She remembered his
parting words at the bazaar. She remembered the momentary feeling of reliance
that had sprung in her when he was talking with her, and she waited with
yearning expectation for the opportunity of confiding everything to him. Her
mother called every day at Mr Deane&rsquo;s to learn how Lucy was; the report
was always sad,&mdash;nothing had yet roused her from the feeble passivity
which had come on with the first shock. But of Philip, Mrs Tulliver had
learned nothing; naturally, no one whom she met would speak to her about what
related to her daughter. But at last she summoned courage to go and see sister
Glegg, who of course would know everything, and had been even to see Tom at the
Mill in Mrs Tulliver&rsquo;s absence, though he had said nothing of what had
passed on the occasion.
</p>

<p>
As soon as her mother was gone, Maggie put on her bonnet. She had resolved on
walking to the Rectory and asking to see Dr Kenn; he was in deep grief, but
the grief of another does not jar upon us in such circumstances. It was the
first time she had been beyond the door since her return; nevertheless her mind
was so bent on the purpose of her walk, that the unpleasantness of meeting
people on the way, and being stared at, did not occur to her. But she had no
sooner passed beyond the narrower streets which she had to thread from
Bob&rsquo;s dwelling, than she became aware of unusual glances cast at her; and
this consciousness made her hurry along nervously, afraid to look to right or
left. Presently, however, she came full on Mrs and Miss Turnbull, old
acquaintances of her family; they both looked at her strangely, and turned a
little aside without speaking. All hard looks were pain to Maggie, but her
self-reproach was too strong for resentment. No wonder they will not speak to
me, she thought; they are very fond of Lucy. But now she knew that she was
about to pass a group of gentlemen, who were standing at the door of the
billiard-rooms, and she could not help seeing young Torry step out a little
with his glass at his eye, and bow to her with that air of <i>nonchalance</i>
which he might have bestowed on a friendly barmaid.
</p>

<p>
Maggie&rsquo;s pride was too intense for her not to feel that sting, even in
the midst of her sorrow; and for the first time the thought took strong hold of
her that she would have other obloquy cast on her besides that which was felt
to be due to her breach of faith toward Lucy. But she was at the Rectory now;
there, perhaps, she would find something else than retribution. Retribution may
come from any voice; the hardest, cruelest, most imbruted urchin at the
street-corner can inflict it; surely help and pity are rarer things, more
needful for the righteous to bestow.
</p>

<p>
She was shown up at once, after being announced, into Dr Kenn&rsquo;s study,
where he sat amongst piled-up books, for which he had little appetite, leaning
his cheek against the head of his youngest child, a girl of three. The child
was sent away with the servant, and when the door was closed, Dr Kenn said,
placing a chair for Maggie,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was coming to see you, Miss Tulliver; you have anticipated me; I am
glad you did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie looked at him with her childlike directness as she had done at the
bazaar, and said, &ldquo;I want to tell you everything.&rdquo; But her eyes
filled fast with tears as she said it, and all the pent-up excitement of her
humiliating walk would have its vent before she could say more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do tell me everything,&rdquo; Dr Kenn said, with quiet kindness in his
grave, firm voice. &ldquo;Think of me as one to whom a long experience has been
granted, which may enable him to help you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In rather broken sentences, and with some effort at first, but soon with the
greater ease that came from a sense of relief in the confidence, Maggie told
the brief story of a struggle that must be the beginning of a long sorrow. Only
the day before, Dr Kenn had been made acquainted with the contents of
Stephen&rsquo;s letter, and he had believed them at once, without the
confirmation of Maggie&rsquo;s statement. That involuntary plaint of hers,
&ldquo;<i>Oh, I must go</i>,&rdquo; had remained with him as the sign that she
was undergoing some inward conflict.
</p>

<p>
Maggie dwelt the longest on the feeling which had made her come back to her
mother and brother, which made her cling to all the memories of the past. When
she had ended, Dr Kenn was silent for some minutes; there was a difficulty on
his mind. He rose, and walked up and down the hearth with his hands behind him.
At last he seated himself again, and said, looking at Maggie,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your prompting to go to your nearest friends,&mdash;to remain where all
the ties of your life have been formed,&mdash;is a true prompting, to which the
Church in its original constitution and discipline responds, opening its arms
to the penitent, watching over its children to the last; never abandoning them
until they are hopelessly reprobate. And the Church ought to represent the
feeling of the community, so that every parish should be a family knit together
by Christian brotherhood under a spiritual father. But the ideas of discipline
and Christian fraternity are entirely relaxed,&mdash;they can hardly be said to
exist in the public mind; they hardly survive except in the partial,
contradictory form they have taken in the narrow communities of schismatics;
and if I were not supported by the firm faith that the Church must ultimately
recover the full force of that constitution which is alone fitted to human
needs, I should often lose heart at observing the want of fellowship and sense
of mutual responsibility among my own flock. At present everything seems
tending toward the relaxation of ties,&mdash;toward the substitution of wayward
choice for the adherence to obligation, which has its roots in the past. Your
conscience and your heart have given you true light on this point, Miss
Tulliver; and I have said all this that you may know what my wish about
you&mdash;what my advice to you&mdash;would be, if they sprang from my own
feeling and opinion unmodified by counteracting circumstances.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr Kenn paused a little while. There was an entire absence of effusive
benevolence in his manner; there was something almost cold in the gravity of
his look and voice. If Maggie had not known that his benevolence was
persevering in proportion to its reserve, she might have been chilled and
frightened. As it was, she listened expectantly, quite sure that there would be
some effective help in his words. He went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your inexperience of the world, Miss Tulliver, prevents you from
anticipating fully the very unjust conceptions that will probably be formed
concerning your conduct,&mdash;conceptions which will have a baneful effect,
even in spite of known evidence to disprove them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I do,&mdash;I begin to see,&rdquo; said Maggie, unable to repress
this utterance of her recent pain. &ldquo;I know I shall be insulted. I shall
be thought worse than I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You perhaps do not yet know,&rdquo; said Dr Kenn, with a touch of more
personal pity, &ldquo;that a letter is come which ought to satisfy every one
who has known anything of you, that you chose the steep and difficult path of a
return to the right, at the moment when that return was most of all
difficult.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, where is he?&rdquo; said poor Maggie, with a flush and tremor that
no presence could have hindered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is gone abroad; he has written of all that passed to his father. He
has vindicated you to the utmost; and I hope the communication of that letter
to your cousin will have a beneficial effect on her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr Kenn waited for her to get calm again before he went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That letter, as I said, ought to suffice to prevent false impressions
concerning you. But I am bound to tell you, Miss Tulliver, that not only the
experience of my whole life, but my observation within the last three days,
makes me fear that there is hardly any evidence which will save you from the
painful effect of false imputations. The persons who are the most incapable of
a conscientious struggle such as yours are precisely those who will be likely
to shrink from you, because they will not believe in your struggle. I fear your
life here will be attended not only with much pain, but with many obstructions.
For this reason&mdash;and for this only&mdash;I ask you to consider whether it
will not perhaps be better for you to take a situation at a distance, according
to your former intention. I will exert myself at once to obtain one for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if I could but stop here!&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;I have no heart
to begin a strange life again. I should have no stay. I should feel like a
lonely wanderer, cut off from the past. I have written to the lady who offered
me a situation to excuse myself. If I remained here, I could perhaps atone in
some way to Lucy&mdash;to others; I could convince them that I&rsquo;m sorry.
And,&rdquo; she added, with some of the old proud fire flashing out, &ldquo;I
will not go away because people say false things of me. They shall learn to
retract them. If I must go away at last, because&mdash;because others wish it,
I will not go now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dr Kenn, after some consideration, &ldquo;if you
determine on that, Miss Tulliver, you may rely on all the influence my position
gives me. I am bound to aid and countenance you by the very duties of my office
as a parish priest. I will add, that personally I have a deep interest in your
peace of mind and welfare.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only thing I want is some occupation that will enable me to get my
bread and be independent,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;I shall not want much. I
can go on lodging where I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must think over the subject maturely,&rdquo; said Dr Kenn, &ldquo;and
in a few days I shall be better able to ascertain the general feeling. I shall
come to see you; I shall bear you constantly in mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Maggie had left him, Dr Kenn stood ruminating with his hands behind him,
and his eyes fixed on the carpet, under a painful sense of doubt and
difficulty. The tone of Stephen&rsquo;s letter, which he had read, and the
actual relations of all the persons concerned, forced upon him powerfully the
idea of an ultimate marriage between Stephen and Maggie as the least evil; and
the impossibility of their proximity in St Ogg&rsquo;s on any other
supposition, until after years of separation, threw an insurmountable
prospective difficulty over Maggie&rsquo;s stay there. On the other hand, he
entered with all the comprehension of a man who had known spiritual conflict,
and lived through years of devoted service to his fellow-men, into that state
of Maggie&rsquo;s heart and conscience which made the consent to the marriage a
desecration to her; her conscience must not be tampered with; the principle on
which she had acted was a safer guide than any balancing of consequences. His
experience told him that intervention was too dubious a responsibility to be
lightly incurred; the possible issue either of an endeavor to restore the
former relations with Lucy and Philip, or of counselling submission to this
irruption of a new feeling, was hidden in a darkness all the more impenetrable
because each immediate step was clogged with evil.
</p>

<p>
The great problem of the shifting relation between passion and duty is clear to
no man who is capable of apprehending it; the question whether the moment has
come in which a man has fallen below the possibility of a renunciation that
will carry any efficacy, and must accept the sway of a passion against which he
had struggled as a trespass, is one for which we have no master-key that will
fit all cases. The casuists have become a byword of reproach; but their
perverted spirit of minute discrimination was the shadow of a truth to which
eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealed,&mdash;the truth, that moral
judgments must remain false and hollow, unless they are checked and enlightened
by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the individual
lot.
</p>

<p>
All people of broad, strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to the men of
maxims; because such people early discern that the mysterious complexity of our
life is not to be embraced by maxims, and that to lace ourselves up in formulas
of that sort is to repress all the divine promptings and inspirations that
spring from growing insight and sympathy. And the man of maxims is the popular
representative of the minds that are guided in their moral judgment solely by
general rules, thinking that these will lead them to justice by a ready-made
patent method, without the trouble of exerting patience, discrimination,
impartiality,&mdash;without any care to assure themselves whether they have the
insight that comes from a hardly earned estimate of temptation, or from a life
vivid and intense enough to have created a wide fellow-feeling with all that is
human.

Showing That Old Acquaintances Are Capable of Surprising Us</h3>

<p>
When Maggie was at home again, her mother brought her news of an unexpected
line of conduct in aunt Glegg. As long as Maggie had not been heard of, Mrs
Glegg had half closed her shutters and drawn down her blinds. She felt assured
that Maggie was drowned; that was far more probable than that her niece and
legatee should have done anything to wound the family honour in the tenderest
point. When at last she learned from Tom that Maggie had come home, and
gathered from him what was her explanation of her absence, she burst forth in
severe reproof of Tom for admitting the worst of his sister until he was
compelled. If you were not to stand by your &ldquo;kin&rdquo; as long as there
was a shred of honour attributable to them, pray what were you to stand by?
Lightly to admit conduct in one of your own family that would force you to
alter your will, had never been the way of the Dodsons; and though Mrs Glegg
had always augured ill of Maggie&rsquo;s future at a time when other people
were perhaps less clear-sighted, yet fair play was a jewel, and it was not for
her own friends to help to rob the girl of her fair fame, and to cast her out
from family shelter to the scorn of the outer world, until she had become
unequivocally a family disgrace. The circumstances were unprecedented in Mrs
Glegg&rsquo;s experience; nothing of that kind had happened among the Dodsons
before; but it was a case in which her hereditary rectitude and personal
strength of character found a common channel along with her fundamental ideas
of clanship, as they did in her lifelong regard to equity in money matters. She
quarrelled with Mr Glegg, whose kindness, flowing entirely into compassion for
Lucy, made him as hard in his judgment of Maggie as Mr Deane himself was; and
fuming against her sister Tulliver because she did not at once come to her for
advice and help, shut herself up in her own room with Baxter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Saints&rsquo; Rest&rdquo; from morning till night, denying herself to
all visitors, till Mr Glegg brought from Mr Deane the news of Stephen&rsquo;s
letter. Then Mrs Glegg felt that she had adequate fighting-ground; then she
laid aside Baxter, and was ready to meet all comers. While Mrs Pullet could do
nothing but shake her head and cry, and wish that cousin Abbot had died, or any
number of funerals had happened rather than this, which had never happened
before, so that there was no knowing how to act, and Mrs Pullet could never
enter St Ogg&rsquo;s again, because &ldquo;acquaintances&rdquo; knew of it
all, Mrs Glegg only hoped that Mrs Wooll, or any one else, would come to her
with their false tales about her own niece, and she would know what to say to
that ill-advised person!
</p>

<p>
Again she had a scene of remonstrance with Tom, all the more severe in
proportion to the greater strength of her present position. But Tom, like other
immovable things, seemed only the more rigidly fixed under that attempt to
shake him. Poor Tom! he judged by what he had been able to see; and the
judgment was painful enough to himself. He thought he had the demonstration of
facts observed through years by his own eyes, which gave no warning of their
imperfection, that Maggie&rsquo;s nature was utterly untrustworthy, and too
strongly marked with evil tendencies to be safely treated with leniency. He
would act on that demonstration at any cost; but the thought of it made his
days bitter to him. Tom, like every one of us, was imprisoned within the limits
of his own nature, and his education had simply glided over him, leaving a
slight deposit of polish; if you are inclined to be severe on his severity,
remember that the responsibility of tolerance lies with those who have the
wider vision. There had arisen in Tom a repulsion toward Maggie that derived
its very intensity from their early childish love in the time when they had
clasped tiny fingers together, and their later sense of nearness in a common
duty and a common sorrow; the sight of her, as he had told her, was hateful to
him. In this branch of the Dodson family aunt Glegg found a stronger nature
than her own; a nature in which family feeling had lost the character of
clanship by taking on a doubly deep dye of personal pride.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Glegg allowed that Maggie ought to be punished,&mdash;she was not a woman
to deny that; she knew what conduct was,&mdash;but punished in proportion to
the misdeeds proved against her, not to those which were cast upon her by
people outside her own family who might wish to show that their own kin were
better.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your aunt Glegg scolded me so as niver was, my dear,&rdquo; said poor
Mrs Tulliver, when she came back to Maggie, &ldquo;as I didn&rsquo;t go to her
before; she said it wasn&rsquo;t for her to come to me first. But she spoke
like a sister, too; <i>having</i> she allays was, and hard to please,&mdash;oh
dear!&mdash;but she&rsquo;s said the kindest word as has ever been spoke by you
yet, my child. For she says, for all she&rsquo;s been so set again&rsquo;
having one extry in the house, and making extry spoons and things, and putting
her about in her ways, you shall have a shelter in her house, if you&rsquo;ll
go to her dutiful, and she&rsquo;ll uphold you against folks as say harm of you
when they&rsquo;ve no call. And I told her I thought you couldn&rsquo;t bear to
see anybody but me, you were so beat down with trouble; but she said,
&lsquo;<i>I</i> won&rsquo;t throw ill words at her; there&rsquo;s them out
o&rsquo; th&rsquo; family &rsquo;ull be ready enough to do that. But I&rsquo;ll
give her good advice; an&rsquo; she must be humble.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s wonderful
o&rsquo; Jane; for I&rsquo;m sure she used to throw everything I did wrong at
me,&mdash;if it was the raisin-wine as turned out bad, or the pies too hot, or
whativer it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; said poor Maggie, shrinking from the thought of all
the contact her bruised mind would have to bear, &ldquo;tell her I&rsquo;m very
grateful; I&rsquo;ll go to see her as soon as I can; but I can&rsquo;t see any
one just yet, except Dr Kenn. I&rsquo;ve been to him,&mdash;he will advise me,
and help me to get some occupation. I can&rsquo;t live with any one, or be
dependent on them, tell aunt Glegg; I must get my own bread. But did you hear
nothing of Philip&mdash;Philip Wakem? Have you never seen any one that has
mentioned him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, my dear; but I&rsquo;ve been to Lucy&rsquo;s, and I saw your uncle,
and he says they got her to listen to the letter, and she took notice o&rsquo;
Miss Guest, and asked questions, and the doctor thinks she&rsquo;s on the turn
to be better. What a world this is,&mdash;what trouble, oh dear! The law was
the first beginning, and it&rsquo;s gone from bad to worse, all of a sudden,
just when the luck seemed on the turn?&rdquo; This was the first lamentation
that Mrs Tulliver had let slip to Maggie, but old habit had been revived by
the interview with sister Glegg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor, poor mother!&rdquo; Maggie burst out, cut to the heart with
pity and compunction, and throwing her arms round her mother&rsquo;s neck;
&ldquo;I was always naughty and troublesome to you. And now you might have been
happy if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Tulliver, leaning toward the warm young
cheek; &ldquo;I must put up wi&rsquo; my children,&mdash;I shall never have no
more; and if they bring me bad luck, I must be fond on it. There&rsquo;s
nothing else much to be fond on, for my furnitur&rsquo; went long ago. And
you&rsquo;d got to be very good once; I can&rsquo;t think how it&rsquo;s turned
out the wrong way so!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Still two or three more days passed, and Maggie heard nothing of Philip;
anxiety about him was becoming her predominant trouble, and she summoned
courage at last to inquire about him of Dr Kenn, on his next visit to her. He
did not even know if Philip was at home. The elder Wakem was made moody by an
accumulation of annoyance; the disappointment in this young Jetsome, to whom,
apparently, he was a good deal attached, had been followed close by the
catastrophe to his son&rsquo;s hopes after he had done violence to his own
strong feeling by conceding to them, and had incautiously mentioned this
concession in St Ogg&rsquo;s; and he was almost fierce in his brusqueness when
any one asked him a question about his son.
</p>

<p>
But Philip could hardly have been ill, or it would have been known through the
calling in of the medical man; it was probable that he was gone out of the town
for a little while. Maggie sickened under this suspense, and her imagination
began to live more and more persistently in what Philip was enduring. What did
he believe about her?
</p>

<p>
At last Bob brought her a letter, without a postmark, directed in a hand which
she knew familiarly in the letters of her own name,&mdash;a hand in which her
name had been written long ago, in a pocket Shakespeare which she possessed.
Her mother was in the room, and Maggie, in violent agitation, hurried upstairs
that she might read the letter in solitude. She read it with a throbbing brow.
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Maggie,&mdash;I believe in you; I know you never meant to deceive me; I
know you tried to keep faith to me and to all. I believed this before I had any
other evidence of it than your own nature. The night after I last parted from
you I suffered torments. I had seen what convinced me that you were not free;
that there was another whose presence had a power over you which mine never
possessed; but through all the suggestions&mdash;almost murderous
suggestions&mdash;of rage and jealousy, my mind made its way to believe in your
truthfulness. I was sure that you meant to cleave to me, as you had said; that
you had rejected him; that you struggled to renounce him, for Lucy&rsquo;s sake
and for mine. But I could see no issue that was not fatal for <i>you;</i> and
that dread shut out the very thought of resignation. I foresaw that he would
not relinquish you, and I believed then, as I believe now, that the strong
attraction which drew you together proceeded only from one side of your
characters, and belonged to that partial, divided action of our nature which
makes half the tragedy of the human lot. I have felt the vibration of chords in
your nature that I have continually felt the want of in his. But perhaps I am
wrong; perhaps I feel about you as the artist does about the scene over which
his soul has brooded with love; he would tremble to see it confided to other
hands; he would never believe that it could bear for another all the meaning
and the beauty it bears for him.<br/>
    &ldquo;I dared not trust myself to see you that morning; I was filled with
selfish passion; I was shattered by a night of conscious delirium. I told you
long ago that I had never been resigned even to the mediocrity of my powers;
how could I be resigned to the loss of the one thing which had ever come to me
on earth with the promise of such deep joy as would give a new and blessed
meaning to the foregoing pain,&mdash;the promise of another self that would
lift my aching affection into the divine rapture of an ever-springing,
ever-satisfied want?<br/>
    &ldquo;But the miseries of that night had prepared me for what came before the
next. It was no surprise to me. I was certain that he had prevailed on you to
sacrifice everything to him, and I waited with equal certainty to hear of your
marriage. I measured your love and his by my own. But I was wrong, Maggie.
There is something stronger in you than your love for him.<br/>
    &ldquo;I will not tell you what I went through in that interval. But even in
its utmost agony&mdash;even in those terrible throes that love must suffer
before it can be disembodied of selfish desire&mdash;my love for you sufficed
to withhold me from suicide, without the aid of any other motive. In the midst
of my egoism, I yet could not bear to come like a death-shadow across the feast
of your joy. I could not bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and
might need me; it was part of the faith I had vowed to you,&mdash;to wait and
endure. Maggie, that is a proof of what I write now to assure you
of,&mdash;that no anguish I have had to bear on your account has been too heavy
a price to pay for the new life into which I have entered in loving you. I want
you to put aside all grief because of the grief you have caused me. I was
nurtured in the sense of privation; I never expected happiness; and in knowing
you, in loving you, I have had, and still have, what reconciles me to life. You
have been to my affections what light, what colour is to my eyes, what music is
to the inward ear, you have raised a dim unrest into a vivid consciousness. The
new life I have found in caring for your joy and sorrow more than for what is
directly my own, has transformed the spirit of rebellious murmuring into that
willing endurance which is the birth of strong sympathy. I think nothing but
such complete and intense love could have initiated me into that enlarged life
which grows and grows by appropriating the life of others; for before, I was
always dragged back from it by ever-present painful self-consciousness. I even
think sometimes that this gift of transferred life which has come to me in
loving you, may be a new power to me.<br/>
    &ldquo;Then, dear one, in spite of all, you have been the blessing of my life.
Let no self-reproach weigh on you because of me. It is I who should rather
reproach myself for having urged my feelings upon you, and hurried you into
words that you have felt as fetters. You meant to be true to those words; you
<i>have</i> been true. I can measure your sacrifice by what I have known in
only one half-hour of your presence with me, when I dreamed that you might love
me best. But, Maggie, I have no just claim on you for more than affectionate
remembrance.<br/>
    &ldquo;For some time I have shrunk from writing to you, because I have shrunk
even from the appearance of wishing to thrust myself before you, and so
repeating my original error. But you will not misconstrue me. I know that we
must keep apart for a long while; cruel tongues would force us apart, if
nothing else did. But I shall not go away. The place where you are is the one
where my mind must live, wherever I might travel. And remember that I am
unchangeably yours,&mdash;yours not with selfish wishes, but with a devotion
that excludes such wishes.<br/>
    &ldquo;God comfort you, my loving, large-souled Maggie. If every one else has
misconceived you, remember that you have never been doubted by him whose heart
recognised you ten years ago.<br/>
    &ldquo;Do not believe any one who says I am ill, because I am not seen out of
doors. I have only had nervous headaches,&mdash;no worse than I have sometimes
had them before. But the overpowering heat inclines me to be perfectly
quiescent in the daytime. I am strong enough to obey any word which shall tell
me that I can serve you by word or deed.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;Yours to the last,<br/>
&ldquo;<i>Philip Wakem</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Maggie knelt by the bed sobbing, with that letter pressed under her, her
feelings again and again gathered themselves in a whispered cry, always in the
same words,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O God, is there any happiness in love that could make me forget
<i>their</i> pain?&rdquo;

Maggie and Lucy</h3>

<p>
By the end of the week Dr Kenn had made up his mind that there was only one
way in which he could secure to Maggie a suitable living at St Ogg&rsquo;s.
Even with his twenty years&rsquo; experience as a parish priest, he was aghast
at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her in the face of
evidence. Hitherto he had been rather more adored and appealed to than was
quite agreeable to him; but now, in attempting to open the ears of women to
reason, and their consciences to justice, on behalf of Maggie Tulliver, he
suddenly found himself as powerless as he was aware he would have been if he
had attempted to influence the shape of bonnets. Dr Kenn could not be
contradicted; he was listened to in silence; but when he left the room, a
comparison of opinions among his hearers yielded much the same result as
before. Miss Tulliver had undeniably acted in a blamable manner, even Dr Kenn
did not deny that; how, then, could he think so lightly of her as to put that
favourable interpretation on everything she had done? Even on the supposition
that required the utmost stretch of belief,&mdash;namely, that none of the
things said about Miss Tulliver were true,&mdash;still, since they <i>had</i>
been said about her, they had cast an odor round her which must cause her to be
shrunk from by every woman who had to take care of her own reputation&mdash;and
of Society. To have taken Maggie by the hand and said, &ldquo;I will not
believe unproved evil of you; my lips shall not utter it; my ears shall be
closed against it; I, too, am an erring mortal, liable to stumble, apt to come
short of my most earnest efforts; your lot has been harder than mine, your
temptation greater; let us help each other to stand and walk without more
falling,&rdquo;&mdash;to have done this would have demanded courage, deep pity,
self-knowledge, generous trust; would have demanded a mind that tasted no
piquancy in evil-speaking, that felt no self-exaltation in condemning, that
cheated itself with no large words into the belief that life can have any moral
end, any high religion, which excludes the striving after perfect truth,
justice, and love toward the individual men and women who come across our own
path. The ladies of St Ogg&rsquo;s were not beguiled by any wide speculative
conceptions; but they had their favourite abstraction, called Society, which
served to make their consciences perfectly easy in doing what satisfied their
own egoism,&mdash;thinking and speaking the worst of Maggie Tulliver, and
turning their backs upon her. It was naturally disappointing to Dr Kenn, after
two years of superfluous incense from his feminine parishioners, to find them
suddenly maintaining their views in opposition to his; but then they maintained
them in opposition to a higher Authority, which they had venerated longer. That
Authority had furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire
where their social duties began, and might be inclined to take wide views as to
the starting-point. The answer had not turned on the ultimate good of Society,
but on &ldquo;a certain man&rdquo; who was found in trouble by the wayside.
</p>

<p>
Not that St Ogg&rsquo;s was empty of women with some tenderness of heart and
conscience; probably it had as fair a proportion of human goodness in it as any
other small trading town of that day. But until every good man is brave, we
must expect to find many good women timid,&mdash;too timid even to believe in
the correctness of their own best promptings, when these would place them in a
minority. And the men at St Ogg&rsquo;s were not all brave, by any means; some
of them were even fond of scandal, and to an extent that might have given their
conversation an effeminate character, if it had not been distinguished by
masculine jokes, and by an occasional shrug of the shoulders at the mutual
hatred of women. It was the general feeling of the masculine mind at St
Ogg&rsquo;s that women were not to be interfered with in their treatment of
each other.
</p>

<p>
And thus every direction in which Dr Kenn had turned, in the hope of procuring
some kind recognition and some employment for Maggie, proved a disappointment
to him. Mrs James Torry could not think of taking Maggie as a nursery
governess, even temporarily,&mdash;a young woman about whom &ldquo;such things
had been said,&rdquo; and about whom &ldquo;gentlemen joked&rdquo;; and Miss
Kirke, who had a spinal complaint, and wanted a reader and companion, felt
quite sure that Maggie&rsquo;s mind must be of a quality with which she, for
her part, could not risk <i>any</i> contact. Why did not Miss Tulliver accept
the shelter offered her by her aunt Glegg? It did not become a girl like her to
refuse it. Or else, why did she not go out of the neighbourhood, and get a
situation where she was not known? (It was not, apparently, of so much
importance that she should carry her dangerous tendencies into strange families
unknown at St Ogg&rsquo;s.) She must be very bold and hardened to wish to stay
in a parish where she was so much stared at and whispered about.
</p>

<p>
Dr Kenn, having great natural firmness, began, in the presence of this
opposition, as every firm man would have done, to contract a certain strength
of determination over and above what would have been called forth by the end in
view. He himself wanted a daily governess for his younger children; and though
he had hesitated in the first instance to offer this position to Maggie, the
resolution to protest with the utmost force of his personal and priestly
character against her being crushed and driven away by slander, was now
decisive. Maggie gratefully accepted an employment that gave her duties as well
as a support; her days would be filled now, and solitary evenings would be a
welcome rest. She no longer needed the sacrifice her mother made in staying
with her, and Mrs Tulliver was persuaded to go back to the Mill.
</p>

<p>
But now it began to be discovered that Dr Kenn, exemplary as he had hitherto
appeared, had his crotchets, possibly his weaknesses. The masculine mind of St
Ogg&rsquo;s smiled pleasantly, and did not wonder that Kenn liked to see a fine
pair of eyes daily, or that he was inclined to take so lenient a view of the
past; the feminine mind, regarded at that period as less powerful, took a more
melancholy view of the case. If Dr Kenn should be beguiled into marrying that
Miss Tulliver! It was not safe to be too confident, even about the best of men;
an apostle had fallen, and wept bitterly afterwards; and though Peter&rsquo;s
denial was not a close precedent, his repentance was likely to be.
</p>

<p>
Maggie had not taken her daily walks to the Rectory for many weeks, before the
dreadful possibility of her some time or other becoming the Rector&rsquo;s wife
had been talked of so often in confidence, that ladies were beginning to
discuss how they should behave to her in that position. For Dr Kenn, it had
been understood, had sat in the schoolroom half an hour one morning, when Miss
Tulliver was giving her lessons,&mdash;nay, he had sat there every morning; he
had once walked home with her,&mdash;he almost <i>always</i> walked home with
her,&mdash;and if not, he went to see her in the evening. What an artful
creature she was! What a <i>mother</i> for those children! It was enough to
make poor Mrs Kenn turn in her grave, that they should be put under the care
of this girl only a few weeks after her death. Would he be so lost to propriety
as to marry her before the year was out? The masculine mind was sarcastic, and
thought <i>not</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Miss Guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly in their
Rector; at least their brother would be safe; and their knowledge of
Stephen&rsquo;s tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to them, lest he should
come back and marry Maggie. They were not among those who disbelieved their
brother&rsquo;s letter; but they had no confidence in Maggie&rsquo;s adherence
to her renunciation of him; they suspected that she had shrunk rather from the
elopement than from the marriage, and that she lingered in St Ogg&rsquo;s,
relying on his return to her. They had always thought her disagreeable; they
now thought her artful and proud; having quite as good grounds for that
judgment as you and I probably have for many strong opinions of the same kind.
Formerly they had not altogether delighted in the contemplated match with Lucy,
but now their dread of a marriage between Stephen and Maggie added its momentum
to their genuine pity and indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl, in
making them desire that he should return to her. As soon as Lucy was able to
leave home, she was to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this August by
going to the coast with the Miss Guests; and it was in their plans that Stephen
should be induced to join them. On the very first hint of gossip concerning
Maggie and Dr Kenn, the report was conveyed in Miss Guest&rsquo;s letter to
her brother.
</p>

<p>
Maggie had frequent tidings through her mother, or aunt Glegg, or Dr Kenn, of
Lucy&rsquo;s gradual progress toward recovery, and her thoughts tended
continually toward her uncle Deane&rsquo;s house; she hungered for an interview
with Lucy, if it were only for five minutes, to utter a word of penitence, to
be assured by Lucy&rsquo;s own eyes and lips that she did not believe in the
willing treachery of those whom she had loved and trusted. But she knew that
even if her uncle&rsquo;s indignation had not closed his house against her, the
agitation of such an interview would have been forbidden to Lucy. Only to have
seen her without speaking would have been some relief; for Maggie was haunted
by a face cruel in its very gentleness; a face that had been turned on hers
with glad, sweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory;
changed now to a sad and weary face by a first heart-stroke. And as the days
passed on, that pale image became more and more distinct; the picture grew and
grew into more speaking definiteness under the avenging hand of remorse; the
soft hazel eyes, in their look of pain, were bent forever on Maggie, and
pierced her the more because she could see no anger in them. But Lucy was not
yet able to go to church, or any place where Maggie could see her; and even the
hope of that departed, when the news was told her by aunt Glegg, that Lucy was
really going away in a few days to Scarborough with the Miss Guests, who had
been heard to say that they expected their brother to meet them there.
</p>

<p>
Only those who have known what hardest inward conflict is, can know what Maggie
felt as she sat in her loneliness the evening after hearing that news from Mrs
Glegg,&mdash;only those who have known what it is to dread their own selfish
desires as the watching mother would dread the sleeping-potion that was to
still her own pain.
</p>

<p>
She sat without candle in the twilight, with the window wide open toward the
river; the sense of oppressive heat adding itself undistinguishably to the
burthen of her lot. Seated on a chair against the window, with her arm on the
windowsill she was looking blankly at the flowing river, swift with the
backward-rushing tide, struggling to see still the sweet face in its
unreproaching sadness, that seemed now from moment to moment to sink away and
be hidden behind a form that thrust itself between, and made darkness. Hearing
the door open, she thought Mrs Jakin was coming in with her supper, as usual;
and with that repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and
wretchedness, she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted nothing; good
little Mrs Jakin would be sure to make some well-meant remarks. But the next
moment, without her having discerned the sound of a footstep, she felt a light
hand on her shoulder, and heard a voice close to her saying,
&ldquo;Maggie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The face was there,&mdash;changed, but all the sweeter; the hazel eyes were
there, with their heart-piercing tenderness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie!&rdquo; the soft voice said. &ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo; answered a voice
with a sharp ring of anguish in it; and Lucy threw her arms round
Maggie&rsquo;s neck, and leaned her pale cheek against the burning brow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I stole out,&rdquo; said Lucy, almost in a whisper, while she sat down
close to Maggie and held her hand, &ldquo;when papa and the rest were away.
Alice is come with me. I asked her to help me. But I must only stay a little
while, because it is so late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was easier to say that at first than to say anything else. They sat looking
at each other. It seemed as if the interview must end without more speech, for
speech was very difficult. Each felt that there would be something scorching in
the words that would recall the irretrievable wrong. But soon, as Maggie
looked, every distinct thought began to be overflowed by a wave of loving
penitence, and words burst forth with a sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God bless you for coming, Lucy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sobs came thick on each other after that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie, dear, be comforted,&rdquo; said Lucy now, putting her cheek
against Maggie&rsquo;s again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grieve.&rdquo; And she sat
still, hoping to soothe Maggie with that gentle caress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to deceive you, Lucy,&rdquo; said Maggie, as soon as
she could speak. &ldquo;It always made me wretched that I felt what I
didn&rsquo;t like you to know. It was because I thought it would all be
conquered, and you might never see anything to wound you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know, dear,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I know you never meant to make me
unhappy. It is a trouble that has come on us all; you have more to bear than I
have&mdash;and you gave him up, when&mdash;you did what it must have been very
hard to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were silent again a little while, sitting with clasped hands, and cheeks
leaned together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; Maggie began again, &ldquo;<i>he</i> struggled too. He
wanted to be true to you. He will come back to you. Forgive him&mdash;he will
be happy then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These words were wrung forth from Maggie&rsquo;s deepest soul, with an effort
like the convulsed clutch of a drowning man. Lucy trembled and was silent.
</p>

<p>
A gentle knock came at the door. It was Alice, the maid, who entered and
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t stay any longer, Miss Deane. They&rsquo;ll find it out,
and there&rsquo;ll be such anger at your coming out so late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucy rose and said, &ldquo;Very well, Alice,&mdash;in a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to go away on Friday, Maggie,&rdquo; she added, when Alice had
closed the door again. &ldquo;When I come back, and am strong, they will let me
do as I like. I shall come to you when I please then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; said Maggie, with another great effort, &ldquo;I pray to
God continually that I may never be the cause of sorrow to you any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pressed the little hand that she held between hers, and looked up into the
face that was bent over hers. Lucy never forgot that look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, that had the solemnity of
confession in it, &ldquo;you are better than I am. I
can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She broke off there, and said no more. But they clasped each other again in a
last embrace.

The Last Conflict</h3>

<p>
In the second week of September, Maggie was again sitting in her lonely room,
battling with the old shadowy enemies that were forever slain and rising again.
It was past midnight, and the rain was beating heavily against the window,
driven with fitful force by the rushing, loud-moaning wind. For the day after
Lucy&rsquo;s visit there had been a sudden change in the weather; the heat and
drought had given way to cold variable winds, and heavy falls of rain at
intervals; and she had been forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until
the weather should become more settled. In the counties higher up the Floss the
rains had been continuous, and the completion of the harvest had been arrested.
And now, for the last two days, the rains on this lower course of the river had
been incessant, so that the old men had shaken their heads and talked of sixty
years ago, when the same sort of weather, happening about the equinox, brought
on the great floods, which swept the bridge away, and reduced the town to great
misery. But the younger generation, who had seen several small floods, thought
lightly of these sombre recollections and forebodings; and Bob Jakin, naturally
prone to take a hopeful view of his own luck, laughed at his mother when she
regretted their having taken a house by the riverside, observing that but for
that they would have had no boats, which were the most lucky of possessions in
case of a flood that obliged them to go to a distance for food.
</p>

<p>
But the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now. There
was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow; threatenings of a worse kind,
from sudden thaws after falls of snow, had often passed off, in the experience
of the younger ones; and at the very worst, the banks would be sure to break
lower down the river when the tide came in with violence, and so the waters
would be carried off, without causing more than temporary inconvenience, and
losses that would be felt only by the poorer sort, whom charity would relieve.
</p>

<p>
All were in their beds now, for it was past midnight; all except some solitary
watchers such as Maggie. She was seated in her little parlour toward the river,
with one candle, that left everything dim in the room except a letter which lay
before her on the table. That letter, which had come to her to-day, was one of
the causes that had kept her up far on into the night, unconscious how the
hours were going, careless of seeking rest, with no image of rest coming across
her mind, except of that far, far off rest from which there would be no more
waking for her into this struggling earthly life.
</p>

<p>
Two days before Maggie received that letter, she had been to the Rectory for
the last time. The heavy rain would have prevented her from going since; but
there was another reason. Dr Kenn, at first enlightened only by a few hints as
to the new turn which gossip and slander had taken in relation to Maggie, had
recently been made more fully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one
of his male parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt
to overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance. Dr
Kenn, having a conscience void of offence in the matter, was still inclined to
persevere,&mdash;was still averse to give way before a public sentiment that
was odious and contemptible; but he was finally wrought upon by the
consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to his office, of
avoiding the appearance of evil,&mdash;an &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; that is
always dependent on the average quality of surrounding minds. Where these minds
are low and gross, the area of that &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; is proportionately
widened. Perhaps he was in danger of acting from obstinacy; perhaps it was his
duty to succumb. Conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which
is the most painful course; and to recede was always painful to Dr Kenn. He
made up his mind that he must advise Maggie to go away from St Ogg&rsquo;s for
a time; and he performed that difficult task with as much delicacy as he could,
only stating in vague terms that he found his attempt to countenance her stay
was a source of discord between himself and his parishioners, that was likely
to obstruct his usefulness as a clergyman. He begged her to allow him to write
to a clerical friend of his, who might possibly take her into his own family as
governess; and, if not, would probably know of some other available position
for a young woman in whose welfare Dr Kenn felt a strong interest.
</p>

<p>
Poor Maggie listened with a trembling lip; she could say nothing but a faint
&ldquo;Thank you, I shall be grateful&rdquo;; and she walked back to her
lodgings, through the driving rain, with a new sense of desolation. She must be
a lonely wanderer; she must go out among fresh faces, that would look at her
wonderingly, because the days did not seem joyful to her; she must begin a new
life, in which she would have to rouse herself to receive new impressions; and
she was so unspeakably, sickeningly weary! There was no home, no help for the
erring; even those who pitied were constrained to hardness. But ought she to
complain? Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life, which
was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers,
and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love?
All the next day she sat in her lonely room, with a window darkened by the
cloud and the driving rain, thinking of that future, and wrestling for
patience; for what repose could poor Maggie ever win except by wrestling?
</p>

<p>
And on the third day&mdash;this day of which she had just sat out the
close&mdash;the letter had come which was lying on the table before her.
</p>

<p>
The letter was from Stephen. He was come back from Holland; he was at Mudport
again, unknown to any of his friends, and had written to her from that place,
enclosing the letter to a person whom he trusted in St Ogg&rsquo;s. From
beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach; an appeal against her
useless sacrifice of him, of herself, against that perverted notion of right
which led her to crush all his hopes, for the sake of a mere idea, and not any
substantial good,&mdash;<i>his</i> hopes, whom she loved, and who loved her
with that single overpowering passion, that worship, which a man never gives to
a woman more than once in his life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They have written to me that you are to marry Kenn. As if I should
believe that! Perhaps they have told you some such fables about me. Perhaps
they tell you I&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;travelling.&rsquo; My body has been
dragged about somewhere; but <i>I</i> have never travelled from the hideous
place where you left me; where I started up from the stupor of helpless rage to
find you gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maggie! whose pain can have been like mine? Whose injury is like mine?
Who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself into my
soul, so that no other image can come there? Maggie, call me back to you! Call
me back to life and goodness! I am banished from both now. I have no motives; I
am indifferent to everything. Two months have only deepened the certainty that
I can never care for life without you. Write me one word; say
&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; In two days I should be with you. Maggie, have you
forgotten what it was to be together,&mdash;to be within reach of a look, to be
within hearing of each other&rsquo;s voice?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Maggie first read this letter she felt as if her real temptation had only
just begun. At the entrance of the chill dark cavern, we turn with unworn
courage from the warm light; but how, when we have trodden far in the damp
darkness, and have begun to be faint and weary; how, if there is a sudden
opening above us, and we are invited back again to the life-nourishing day? The
leap of natural longing from under the pressure of pain is so strong, that all
less immediate motives are likely to be forgotten&mdash;till the pain has been
escaped from.
</p>

<p>
For hours Maggie felt as if her struggle had been in vain. For hours every
other thought that she strove to summon was thrust aside by the image of
Stephen waiting for the single word that would bring him to her. She did not
<i>read</i> the letter: she heard him uttering it, and the voice shook her with
its old strange power. All the day before she had been filled with the vision
of a lonely future through which she must carry the burthen of regret, upheld
only by clinging faith. And here, close within her reach, urging itself upon
her even as a claim, was another future, in which hard endurance and effort
were to be exchanged for easy, delicious leaning on another&rsquo;s loving
strength! And yet that promise of joy in the place of sadness did not make the
dire force of the temptation to Maggie.
</p>

<p>
It was Stephen&rsquo;s tone of misery, it was the doubt in the justice of her
own resolve, that made the balance tremble, and made her once start from her
seat to reach the pen and paper, and write &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But close upon that decisive act, her mind recoiled; and the sense of
contradiction with her past self in her moments of strength and clearness came
upon her like a pang of conscious degradation. No, she must wait; she must
pray; the light that had forsaken her would come again; she should feel again
what she had felt when she had fled away, under an inspiration strong enough to
conquer agony,&mdash;to conquer love; she should feel again what she had felt
when Lucy stood by her, when Philip&rsquo;s letter had stirred all the fibres
that bound her to the calmer past.
</p>

<p>
She sat quite still, far on into the night, with no impulse to change her
attitude, without active force enough even for the mental act of prayer; only
waiting for the light that would surely come again. It came with the memories
that no passion could long quench; the long past came back to her, and with it
the fountains of self-renouncing pity and affection, of faithfulness and
resolve. The words that were marked by the quiet hand in the little old book
that she had long ago learned by heart, rushed even to her lips, and found a
vent for themselves in a low murmur that was quite lost in the loud driving of
the rain against the window and the loud moan and roar of the wind. &ldquo;I
have received the Cross, I have received it from Thy hand; I will bear it, and
bear it till death, as Thou hast laid it upon me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But soon other words rose that could find no utterance but in a
sob,&mdash;&ldquo;Forgive me, Stephen! It will pass away. You will come back to
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took up the letter, held it to the candle, and let it burn slowly on the
hearth. To-morrow she would write to him the last word of parting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will bear it, and bear it till death. But how long it will be before
death comes! I am so young, so healthy. How shall I have patience and strength?
Am I to struggle and fall and repent again? Has life other trials as hard for
me still?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With that cry of self-despair, Maggie fell on her knees against the table, and
buried her sorrow-stricken face. Her soul went out to the Unseen Pity that
would be with her to the end. Surely there was something being taught her by
this experience of great need; and she must be learning a secret of human
tenderness and long-suffering, that the less erring could hardly know? &ldquo;O
God, if my life is to be long, let me live to bless and
comfort&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about her knees
and feet; it was water flowing under her. She started up; the stream was
flowing under the door that led into the passage. She was not bewildered for an
instant; she knew it was the flood!
</p>

<p>
The tumult of emotion she had been enduring for the last twelve hours seemed to
have left a great calm in her; without screaming, she hurried with the candle
upstairs to Bob Jakin&rsquo;s bedroom. The door was ajar; she went in and shook
him by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bob, the flood is come! it is in the house; let us see if we can make
the boats safe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She lighted his candle, while the poor wife, snatching up her baby, burst into
screams; and then she hurried down again to see if the waters were rising fast.
There was a step down into the room at the door leading from the staircase; she
saw that the water was already on a level with the step. While she was looking,
something came with a tremendous crash against the window, and sent the leaded
panes and the old wooden framework inward in shivers, the water pouring in
after it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is the boat!&rdquo; cried Maggie. &ldquo;Bob, come down to get the
boats!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And without a moment&rsquo;s shudder of fear, she plunged through the water,
which was rising fast to her knees, and by the glimmering light of the candle
she had left on the stairs, she mounted on to the window-sill, and crept into
the boat, which was left with the prow lodging and protruding through the
window. Bob was not long after her, hurrying without shoes or stockings, but
with the lanthorn in his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re both here,&mdash;both the boats,&rdquo; said Bob, as
he got into the one where Maggie was. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful this
fastening isn&rsquo;t broke too, as well as the mooring.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the excitement of getting into the other boat, unfastening it, and mastering
an oar, Bob was not struck with the danger Maggie incurred. We are not apt to
fear for the fearless, when we are companions in their danger, and Bob&rsquo;s
mind was absorbed in possible expedients for the safety of the helpless
indoors. The fact that Maggie had been up, had waked him, and had taken the
lead in activity, gave Bob a vague impression of her as one who would help to
protect, not need to be protected. She too had got possession of an oar, and
had pushed off, so as to release the boat from the overhanging window-frame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The water&rsquo;s rising so fast,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I doubt
it&rsquo;ll be in at the chambers before long,&mdash;th&rsquo; house is so low.
I&rsquo;ve more mind to get Prissy and the child and the mother into the boat,
if I could, and trusten to the water,&mdash;for th&rsquo; old house is none so
safe. And if I let go the boat&mdash;but <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
suddenly lifting the light of his lanthorn on Maggie, as she stood in the rain
with the oar in her hand and her black hair streaming.
</p>

<p>
Maggie had no time to answer, for a new tidal current swept along the line of
the houses, and drove both the boats out on to the wide water, with a force
that carried them far past the meeting current of the river.
</p>

<p>
In the first moments Maggie felt nothing, thought of nothing, but that she had
suddenly passed away from that life which she had been dreading; it was the
transition of death, without its agony,&mdash;and she was alone in the darkness
with God.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing had been so rapid, so dreamlike, that the threads of ordinary
association were broken; she sank down on the seat clutching the oar
mechanically, and for a long while had no distinct conception of her position.
The first thing that waked her to fuller consciousness was the cessation of the
rain, and a perception that the darkness was divided by the faintest light,
which parted the overhanging gloom from the immeasurable watery level below.
She was driven out upon the flood,&mdash;that awful visitation of God which her
father used to talk of; which had made the nightmare of her childish dreams.
And with that thought there rushed in the vision of the old home, and Tom, and
her mother,&mdash;they had all listened together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O God, where am I? Which is the way home?&rdquo; she cried out, in the
dim loneliness.
</p>

<p>
What was happening to them at the Mill? The flood had once nearly destroyed it.
They might be in danger, in distress,&mdash;her mother and her brother, alone
there, beyond reach of help! Her whole soul was strained now on that thought;
and she saw the long-loved faces looking for help into the darkness, and
finding none.
</p>

<p>
She was floating in smooth water now,&mdash;perhaps far on the overflooded
fields. There was no sense of present danger to check the outgoing of her mind
to the old home; and she strained her eyes against the curtain of gloom that
she might seize the first sight of her whereabout,&mdash;that she might catch
some faint suggestion of the spot toward which all her anxieties tended.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how welcome, the widening of that dismal watery level, the gradual
uplifting of the cloudy firmament, the slowly defining blackness of objects
above the glassy dark! Yes, she must be out on the fields; those were the tops
of hedgerow trees. Which way did the river lie? Looking behind her, she saw the
lines of black trees; looking before her, there were none; then the river lay
before her. She seized an oar and began to paddle the boat forward with the
energy of wakening hope; the dawning seemed to advance more swiftly, now she
was in action; and she could soon see the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously
on a mound where they had taken refuge. Onward she paddled and rowed by turns
in the growing twilight; her wet clothes clung round her, and her streaming
hair was dashed about by the wind, but she was hardly conscious of any bodily
sensations,&mdash;except a sensation of strength, inspired by mighty emotion.
Along with the sense of danger and possible rescue for those long-remembered
beings at the old home, there was an undefined sense of reconcilement with her
brother; what quarrel, what harshness, what unbelief in each other can subsist
in the presence of a great calamity, when all the artificial vesture of our
life is gone, and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs?
Vaguely Maggie felt this, in the strong resurgent love toward her brother that
swept away all the later impressions of hard, cruel offence and
misunderstanding, and left only the deep, underlying, unshakable memories of
early union.
</p>

<p>
But now there was a large dark mass in the distance, and near to her Maggie
could discern the current of the river. The dark mass must be&mdash;yes, it
was&mdash;St Ogg&rsquo;s. Ah, now she knew which way to look for the first
glimpse of the well-known trees&mdash;the gray willows, the now yellowing
chestnuts&mdash;and above them the old roof! But there was no colour, no shape
yet; all was faint and dim. More and more strongly the energies seemed to come
and put themselves forth, as if her life were a stored-up force that was being
spent in this hour, unneeded for any future.
</p>

<p>
She must get her boat into the current of the Floss, else she would never be
able to pass the Ripple and approach the house; this was the thought that
occurred to her, as she imagined with more and more vividness the state of
things round the old home. But then she might be carried very far down, and be
unable to guide her boat out of the current again. For the first time distinct
ideas of danger began to press upon her; but there was no choice of courses, no
room for hesitation, and she floated into the current. Swiftly she went now
without effort; more and more clearly in the lessening distance and the growing
light she began to discern the objects that she knew must be the well-known
trees and roofs; nay, she was not far off a rushing, muddy current that must be
the strangely altered Ripple.
</p>

<p>
Great God! there were floating masses in it, that might dash against her boat
as she passed, and cause her to perish too soon. What were those masses?
</p>

<p>
For the first time Maggie&rsquo;s heart began to beat in an agony of dread. She
sat helpless, dimly conscious that she was being floated along, more intensely
conscious of the anticipated clash. But the horror was transient; it passed
away before the oncoming warehouses of St Ogg&rsquo;s. She had passed the
mouth of the Ripple, then; <i>now</i>, she must use all her skill and power to
manage the boat and get it if possible out of the current. She could see now
that the bridge was broken down; she could see the masts of a stranded vessel
far out over the watery field. But no boats were to be seen moving on the
river,&mdash;such as had been laid hands on were employed in the flooded
streets.
</p>

<p>
With new resolution, Maggie seized her oar, and stood up again to paddle; but
the now ebbing tide added to the swiftness of the river, and she was carried
along beyond the bridge. She could hear shouts from the windows overlooking the
river, as if the people there were calling to her. It was not till she had
passed on nearly to Tofton that she could get the boat clear of the current.
Then with one yearning look toward her uncle Deane&rsquo;s house that lay
farther down the river, she took to both her oars and rowed with all her might
across the watery fields, back toward the Mill. Colour was beginning to awake
now, and as she approached the Dorlcote fields, she could discern the tints of
the trees, could see the old Scotch firs far to the right, and the home
chestnuts,&mdash;oh, how deep they lay in the water,&mdash;deeper than the
trees on this side the hill! And the roof of the Mill&mdash;where was it? Those
heavy fragments hurrying down the Ripple,&mdash;what had they meant? But it was
not the house,&mdash;the house stood firm; drowned up to the first story, but
still firm,&mdash;or was it broken in at the end toward the Mill?
</p>

<p>
With panting joy that she was there at last,&mdash;joy that overcame all
distress,&mdash;Maggie neared the front of the house. At first she heard no
sound; she saw no object moving. Her boat was on a level with the upstairs
window. She called out in a loud, piercing voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom, where are you? Mother, where are you? Here is Maggie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Soon, from the window of the attic in the central gable, she heard Tom&rsquo;s
voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is it? Have you brought a boat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is I, Tom,&mdash;Maggie. Where is mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is not here; she went to Garum the day before yesterday. I&rsquo;ll
come down to the lower window.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alone, Maggie?&rdquo; said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he
opened the middle window, on a level with the boat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you. Get in quickly.
Is there no one else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, stepping into the boat; &ldquo;I fear the man is
drowned; he was carried down the Ripple, I think, when part of the Mill fell
with the crash of trees and stones against it; I&rsquo;ve shouted again and
again, and there has been no answer. Give me the oars, Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the wide water,&mdash;he
face to face with Maggie,&mdash;that the full meaning of what had happened
rushed upon his mind. It came with so overpowering a force,&mdash;it was such a
new revelation to his spirit, of the depths in life that had lain beyond his
vision, which he had fancied so keen and clear,&mdash;that he was unable to ask
a question. They sat mutely gazing at each other,&mdash;Maggie with eyes of
intense life looking out from a weary, beaten face; Tom pale, with a certain
awe and humiliation. Thought was busy though the lips were silent; and though
he could ask no question, he guessed a story of almost miraculous, divinely
protected effort. But at last a mist gathered over the blue-gray eyes, and the
lips found a word they could utter,&mdash;the old childish
&ldquo;Magsie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maggie could make no answer but a long, deep sob of that mysterious, wondrous
happiness that is one with pain.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she could speak, she said, &ldquo;We will go to Lucy, Tom;
we&rsquo;ll go and see if she is safe, and then we can help the rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tom rowed with untired vigor, and with a different speed from poor
Maggie&rsquo;s. The boat was soon in the current of the river again, and soon
they would be at Tofton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Park House stands high up out of the flood,&rdquo; said Maggie.
&ldquo;Perhaps they have got Lucy there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nothing else was said; a new danger was being carried toward them by the river.
Some wooden machinery had just given way on one of the wharves, and huge
fragments were being floated along. The sun was rising now, and the wide area
of watery desolation was spread out in dreadful clearness around them; in
dreadful clearness floated onward the hurrying, threatening masses. A large
company in a boat that was working its way along under the Tofton houses
observed their danger, and shouted, &ldquo;Get out of the current!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But that could not be done at once; and Tom, looking before him, saw death
rushing on them. Huge fragments, clinging together in fatal fellowship, made
one wide mass across the stream.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is coming, Maggie!&rdquo; Tom said, in a deep, hoarse voice, loosing
the oars, and clasping her.
</p>

<p>
The next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water, and the huge mass
was hurrying on in hideous triumph.
</p>

<p>
But soon the keel of the boat reappeared, a black speck on the golden water.
</p>

<p>
The boat reappeared, but brother and sister had gone down in an embrace never
to be parted; living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had
clasped their little hands in love, and roamed the daisied fields together.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Nature repairs her ravages,&mdash;repairs them with her sunshine, and with
human labour. The desolation wrought by that flood had left little visible
trace on the face of the earth, five years after. The fifth autumn was rich in
golden cornstacks, rising in thick clusters among the distant hedgerows; the
wharves and warehouses on the Floss were busy again, with echoes of eager
voices, with hopeful lading and unlading.
</p>

<p>
And every man and woman mentioned in this history was still living, except
those whose end we know.
</p>

<p>
Nature repairs her ravages, but not all. The uptorn trees are not rooted again;
the parted hills are left scarred; if there is a new growth, the trees are not
the same as the old, and the hills underneath their green vesture bear the
marks of the past rending. To the eyes that have dwelt on the past, there is no
thorough repair.
</p>

<p>
Dorlcote Mill was rebuilt. And Dorlcote churchyard&mdash;where the brick grave
that held a father whom we know, was found with the stone laid prostrate upon
it after the flood&mdash;had recovered all its grassy order and decent quiet.
</p>

<p>
Near that brick grave there was a tomb erected, very soon after the flood, for
two bodies that were found in close embrace; and it was visited at different
moments by two men who both felt that their keenest joy and keenest sorrow were
forever buried there.
</p>

<p>
One of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside him; but that was
years after.
</p>

<p>
The other was always solitary. His great companionship was among the trees of
the Red Deeps, where the buried joy seemed still to hover, like a revisiting
spirit.
</p>

<p>
The tomb bore the names of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, and below the names it was
written,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In their death they were not divided.&rdquo;

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
